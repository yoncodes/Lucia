200200004	Sersha	Welcome to <color=#57f0fb>Kuroro Coffee</color>, Commandant. You will now be managing Kuroro Coffee's operations.
200200013	Sersha	Here you can review your <color=#57f0fb>business objectives</color> and the <color=#57f0fb>rewards</color> they offer. You'll need to complete at least one to finish this management session.
200200015	Sersha	Alright, let's jump right into operations!
200201004	Sersha	This is the customer <color=#57f0fb>queue</color>.
200201005	Sersha	This section shows the <color=#57f0fb>business resources</color> each customer provides when seated. Serve them to receive the corresponding resources.
200201013	Sersha	This is the <color=#57f0fb>seating area</color>. Just assign customers to these seats to serve them, and they'll be seated in order.
200201019	Sersha	Alright, let's get a customer seated!
200202013	Sersha	Serving customers will <color=#57f0fb>earn you valuable business resources</color>, and <color=#57f0fb>attract new customers</color> to join your queue!
200202019	Sersha	In Business Status, you can view your <color=#57f0fb>sales volume</color> and <color=#57f0fb>business objectives</color>.
200202023	Sersha	The operations are split into several <color=#57f0fb>time periods</color>. <color=#57f0fb>Customers rotate each period, and any left unserved will leave the queue</color>.
200202025	Sersha	Once you've served your customers, just <color=#57f0fb>check out</color> to move to the next time period. Keep arranging those customers to <color=#57f0fb>boost your sales</color>, Commandant.
200203013	Sersha	These customers can generate great sales, but you'll need to <color=#57f0fb>spend Likes</color> to seat them.
200203019	Sersha	You can see your current <color=#57f0fb>Likes</color> right here.
200203029	Sersha	Commandant, let's start by seating this customer, who can <color=#57f0fb>provide Likes</color>!
200203030	Sersha	Next, seat customers who can <color=#57f0fb>consume Likes</color> to increase your overall sales.
200203032	Sersha	After seating customers, don't forget to <color=#57f0fb>check out</color>!
200204013	Sersha	Look, Commandant! A customer with a special <color=#57f0fb>effect</color> just arrived. Seating them will <color=#57f0fb>increase your seating capacity</color>. Let's get this customer seated first.
200204039	Sersha	This customer <color=#57f0fb>gives extra sales when seated at Seat 4</color>. <color=#57f0fb>If you can't meet the condition yet, try seating other customers first</color>!
200204042	Sersha	This is the final period, Commandant. Don't forget to <color=#57f0fb>check out</color>!
200205004	Sersha	Commandant, you can review past operations and pick up any unclaimed rewards in the <color=#57f0fb>Revenue History</color>.

200207013	Sersha	Commandant, <color=#57f0fb>Lucia</color> is here to help you with the store management. Let's take a quick look at what she can do for you.
200207029	Sersha	Once seated, Lucia will <color=#57f0fb>permanently boost the sales of all seated customers </color> and <color=#57f0fb>never leave the queue whether she's seated or not</color>.
200207031	Sersha	Start by seating Lucia at Seat 1, <color=#57f0fb>and make sure to continue seating her in every time period that follows</color>!
200207032	Sersha	These customers receive buffs from Lucia and will produce additional effects. Go ahead and seat them.
200208013	Sersha	Commandant, <color=#57f0fb>Karenina</color> is here to help! Let's take a look at what she can do.
200208029	Sersha	When seated in <color=#57f0fb>Seat 1</color>, brings in a huge amount of sales. If service gets slow, <color=#57f0fb>converts Likes into substantial sales</color>.
200208031	Sersha	Let's place Karenina in the first seat!
200208032	Sersha	Karenina may appear again later. Before that, focus on <color=#57f0fb>accumulating Likes</color>, then <color=#57f0fb>convert those reviews into sales</color> when she returns.
200209013	Sersha	Commandant, <color=#57f0fb>Karenina</color> is back. Try placing her in a seat further back to <color=#57f0fb>convert Likes into sales</color>.
200209014	Sersha	Start by seating these customers. <color=#57f0fb>Be sure to assign Karenina to Seat 6 or later</color>.
200210013	Sersha	Commandant, <color=#57f0fb>Bianca</color> is here to help! Let's take a look at what she can do.
200210029	Sersha	When Bianca is <color=#57f0fb>not seated</color>, <color=#57f0fb>every seated customer will permanently boost her sales</color>. <color=#57f0fb>Try to seat Bianca during the later time periods</color>.
200210030	Sersha	When Bianca is <color=#57f0fb>seated</color>, she can <color=#57f0fb>attract specific customers</color>. <color=#57f0fb>Wait until you have recruited at least two of Concordia, Palma, and Issarius before seating her</color>.
200210031	Sersha	<color=#57f0fb>Serve more customers to make Concordia, Palma, and Issarius appear faster</color>. Be sure to seat them when they show up!
200211004	Sersha	You've been doing a great job managing everything, Commandant! If you'd like to take on more challenges with Kuroro Coffee, give <color=#57f0fb>Signature Mix</color> a try!
200211015	Sersha	Let's enter <color=#57f0fb>Signature Mix - 1</color>!
200211021	Sersha	Signature Mix stages include <color=#57f0fb>evaluation criteria</color>. <color=#57f0fb>Completing evaluations will help you achieve your business objectives</color>.
200211023	Sersha	You can <color=#57f0fb>freely view and arrange your customers</color>. <color=#57f0fb>They'll appear from your roster during business operations</color>.
200211024	Sersha	This section shows the <color=#57f0fb>required number of each customer type in your list</color>. You must meet all quantity requirements before you can begin operations.
200211025	Sersha	Once you're happy with your setup, it's time to start the challenge!
200212013	Sersha	When Signature Mix begins, you will <color=#57f0fb>randomly receive</color> a set of customers from the roster, plus one chance to <color=#57f0fb>adjust the customers</color>.
200212031	Sersha	Pick customers you don't need right now and swap them out for random new ones.
200212033	Sersha	Once you're happy with your adjustment, tap here to start operating!
200213004	Sersha	Here you can see your <color=#57f0fb>current queue</color> of customers. <color=#57f0fb>Customers from the list will appear randomly in rotation.</color>.
200213029	Sersha	To pass the assessment, <color=#57f0fb>keep a close eye on the Critics' special effects</color>. Your moment has come, Commandant. Do your best to reach the goal!
200230004	Maru Bear	Hello, Commissioner! I'm Maru Bear, the Commercial District's special advisor. Let's get started on the Commercial Square's development plan!
200230016	Maru Bear	Just handle business for <color=#57f0fb>a few rounds</color>, and you'll complete the development plan, bear!
200230018	Maru Bear	Besides the core objectives, there are also additional <color=#57f0fb>development objectives</color>. If you achieve them, <color=#57f0fb>extra rewards</color> will be waiting for you!
200230020	Maru Bear	Set your goals and start building the Commercial Square!
200231004	Maru Bear	The Commercial Square is still empty, so let's start by building the first store!
200231016	Maru Bear	<color=#57f0fb>Retail</color> stores can generate <color=#57f0fb>income</color> for the Commercial Square, so make sure to build one first!
200231023	Maru Bear	To build new stores, you'll need to use <color=#57f0fb>Public Funds</color>. The good news is the council has given us a great startup fund to begin with, so let's get building!
200231028	Maru Bear	The store is built! Now, as the Commissioner, you can offer guidance to retail stores on their <color=#57f0fb>business strategies</color>, bear!
200231030	Maru Bear	But before we jump into strategies, you need to understand what your customers enjoy. So let's open up store and start welcoming them in!
200231035	Maru Bear	Whenever you're ready, tap here to start operations!
200232004	Maru Bear	During operations, you can adjust the <color=#57f0fb>time flow speed</color> anytime to play at your own pace.
200232037	Maru Bear	If things get too busy, feel free to <color=#57f0fb>pause</color> and enjoy a quick cappuccino break.
200233004	Maru Bear	A customer left a <color=#57f0fb>tip</color>! They must've loved the service. Be sure to collect it promptly, Commissioner! Tips disappear if you wait too long.
200234004	Maru Bear	You've received customer <color=#57f0fb>feedback</color>! Tap here to see what they're saying.
200234041	Maru Bear	Feedback received! After operations end, you can use their comments to refine your strategy.
200235004	Maru Bear	We made a great profit that round! Ready to build the next store?
200235016	Maru Bear	This time, we'll be building some fantastic <color=#57f0fb>traffic stores</color>. These are great for attracting <color=#57f0fb>more customers</color> to the Commercial Square.
200235023	Maru Bear	Now, use the Public Funds to build one!
200235028	Maru Bear	Unlike retail stores, traffic stores work automatically—no need for complex management strategies. Simply build them, and they'll start <color=#57f0fb>boosting your customer numbers</color> right away!
200235030	Maru Bear	Perfect, the store is built! Now, let's take a look at the customer feedback we've gathered.
200235035	Maru Bear	You'll find all the collected <color=#57f0fb>feedback</color> displayed neatly right here for you to review.
200235039	Maru Bear	Use your customers' suggestions to try <color=#57f0fb>adjusting your business strategies</color> and make even better decisions!
200235041	Maru Bear	Once you're happy with all your changes, don't forget to hit <color=#57f0fb>save</color> to lock them in!
200236004	Maru Bear	We've earned a solid income! Ready to build our next store?
200236016	Maru Bear	This time, we're going to build a <color=#57f0fb>new type of traffic</color> store.
200236028	Maru Bear	The Genius Board Game Shop can <color=#57f0fb>increase traffic proportionally</color> for the entire square. How about a fun round of Marumaru cards?
200236030	Maru Bear	A quick tip: its effect is more noticeable when traffic is already high. For the best results, I recommend building this after you've already constructed the CUB Experience Store.
200237004	Maru Bear	That's all the tips for now! Next, Commissioner, you'll take on the remaining 12 rounds of operations.
200237016	Maru Bear	If you manage to <color=#57f0fb>complete all development objectives</color> ahead of schedule, you can <color=#57f0fb>finish the stage early</color> and get off work sooner!
200237045	Maru Bear	If you have any questions later, Commissioner, just tap here anytime to check out the Image Guide!
200238004	Maru Bear	Commissioner, welcome to a brand-new round of development! As always, let's begin by building some stores!
200238016	Maru Bear	We've added quite a few new stores for you to build this time!
200238023	Maru Bear	Ready to try out some new retail stores?
200238028	Maru Bear	Unlike Fancy Food, Dolly's Bakery focuses on <color=#57f0fb>adjusting cake designs</color> to win customers' hearts.
200238030	Maru Bear	Tap the button to <color=#57f0fb>adjust ingredient order</color> and redesign your cakes!
200238045	Maru Bear	Dolly's Bakery! It looks like the perfect spot to enjoy sweets. I'm excited!
200238048	Maru Bear	All stores have been built! Commissioner, whenever you're ready, feel free to start operations!
200239004	Maru Bear	Have you noticed, Commissioner? This round's development goal is to refresh the overall <color=#57f0fb>atmosphere</color> of the Commercial Square.
200239016	Maru Bear	Just like traffic stores, atmosphere-enhancing stores also come in two varieties, bear.
200239023	Maru Bear	Let's start by building Bud Isle Flowers. It'll <color=#57f0fb>boost base Atmosphere</color>!
200239028	Maru Bear	In addition to building stores, you can also <color=#57f0fb>upgrade existing ones</color> to increase Atmosphere.
200239030	Maru Bear	Upgrades can be pricey, so it's best to wait until you've saved up enough resources.
200239045	Maru Bear	Let's start building!
200239050	Maru Bear	To boost Atmosphere, you'll need to build the related stores!
200240037	Maru Bear	Because higher <color=#57f0fb>Atmosphere</color> delights your customers, which converts into <color=#57f0fb>Satisfaction</color> during the business phase!
200240041	Maru Bear	Commissioner, keep an eye out. Customer <color=#57f0fb>Satisfaction</color> will sometimes increase during operations.
200240042	Maru Bear	Also, increasing the <color=#57f0fb>rating</color> of retail stores will boost customer <color=#57f0fb>Satisfaction</color> too. Let's go for 100%!
200241004	Maru Bear	Commissioner, a new development objective requires you to <color=#57f0fb>build outer ring stores</color>.
200241016	Maru Bear	Once built, outer ring stores generate <color=#57f0fb>revenue</color> and provide <color=#57f0fb>special effects</color>—each one is <color=#57f0fb>different</color>!
200241045	Maru Bear	Unlocking outer ring stores requires <color=#57f0fb>meeting specific satisfaction conditions</color>. Improve your store ratings and Atmosphere to expand outward sooner, Commissioner!
200241047	Maru Bear	Outer ring stores are located around the edge of the Commercial Square, each run by a different organization.
200241049	Maru Bear	Let's take a look at Akdilek first!
200242004	Maru Bear	Commissioner, how about building a few more retail stores next?
200242016	Maru Bear	Let's begin by taking a look at Inn Elite Department Store.
200242023	Maru Bear	Let's start building, bear!
200242028	Maru Bear	Unlike other retail stores, the Inn Elite Department Store needs you, the Commissioner, to personally choose which products to <color=#57f0fb>stock</color>.
200242030	Maru Bear	Unlike other retail stores, all products in Inn Elite Department Store have <color=#57f0fb>different prices</color>. Please keep this in mind when adjusting your strategies, Commissioner.
200242056	Maru Bear	First, go ahead and stock any three products to see what catches your customers' eyes.
200242061	Maru Bear	Don't forget to save your strategy before you go!
200243004	Maru Bear	Hey Commissioner, check it out! New outer ring stores are ready to build, bear!
200243016	Maru Bear	You can build outer ring stores anytime you have <color=#57f0fb>enough Satisfaction</color>; no public funds are needed.
200243057	Maru Bear	Once built, every outer ring store will immediately launch a <color=#57f0fb>grand opening promotion</color>, and you get to pick the promotional plan from those submitted by the store!
200243059	Maru Bear	Each plan has unique benefits, so choose the one that best fits your overall strategy!
200244004	Maru Bear	Outer ring stores have a different <color=#57f0fb>upgrade method</color> from inner ring stores. They level up by <color=#57f0fb>serving enough happy customers and making sales</color>.
200244016	Maru Bear	To help your stores upgrade, you can officially <color=#57f0fb>recommend</color> one outer ring store to attract <color=#57f0fb>more customers</color>.
200244061	Maru Bear	The unique <color=#57f0fb>special effects</color> of your outer ring stores are now <color=#57f0fb>active</color>, making operations easy peasy!
200245004	Maru Bear	A <color=#57f0fb>sudden event</color> has popped up at an outer ring store. Come check it out, Commissioner!
200245044	Maru Bear	A customer has filed a complaint, but the store has presented its side of the story...
200245046	Maru Bear	You get to <color=#57f0fb>choose</color> which side to support to resolve the situation, Commissioner!
200246057	Maru Bear	After the outer ring stores are built, the Commercial Square will run <color=#57f0fb>regular promotions</color> <color=#57f0fb>at regular intervals</color>.
200246059	Maru Bear	During regular promotions, each outer ring store you've built will suggest some <color=#57f0fb>promotional plans</color>—pick the one that best fits your strategy, Commissioner!
200247057	Maru Bear	You can always check the <color=#57f0fb>countdown</color> here to see when the next regular promotion starts. Be sure to keep an eye on it, Commissioner!
200248047	Maru Bear	The <color=#57f0fb>Ocean Heart Flagship</color> is ready for construction. Don't forget to take a look when you get a chance!
200248057	Maru Bear	Good news, Commissioner! The <color=#57f0fb>Cedar Shop</color> is now available to build.
200249047	Maru Bear	The Golden Daily brings you the headlines, bear! Read it every day, as <color=#57f0fb>different news stories</color> will apply <color=#57f0fb>unique effects</color> to the Commercial Square.
200249057	Maru Bear	Commissioner, the Commercial Square now offers subscriptions to the <color=#57f0fb>Golden Daily</color>!
200249058	Maru Bear	I've heard it sometimes includes <color=#57f0fb>rumors</color> on customer preferences. Once you finish reading, tap here to continue operations.
200250047	Maru Bear	Every time you run a promotion at Marquee, you can <color=#57f0fb>choose</color> one of two promotional plans.
200250057	Maru Bear	Commissioner, this is the Marquee. Here's where you can design marketing campaigns for the Commercial Square.
200250058	Maru Bear	Keep in mind that promotions run on the Marquee are <color=#57f0fb>time-limited</color>. Once the timer ends, the next promotion will begin.
200250061	Maru Bear	If you can <color=#57f0fb>complete the promotional mission</color> objectives before time runs out, you'll receive special <color=#57f0fb>rewards</color>. The choice is yours, Commissioner. Give it a go!
