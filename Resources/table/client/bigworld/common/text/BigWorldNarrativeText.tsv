6	1	—The Last Book—	In this era of electronic reading, even the remote Civil Town has quit using paper books and newspapers—except madman 'Fenster,' a well-known weirdo who always holds a worn-out book that he treasures. Due to his crazy behaviors, even the youngest kids in town refuse to stay away from him.\n\nEveryone in town enjoys making fun of Fenster. All they need to do is tell him that they're interested in his book, and Fenster will introduce it to them in great excitement until his mouth goes dry. Then, they will laugh together at this crazy man, leaving him alone with his day dream.\n\nAccording to Fenster, he can see the dream world described by the book and that is the unique magic of paper books. However, in people's eyes, Fenster is just a mad man having illusions. But his behaviors have drawn the attention of town doctor Quince. In order to include Fenster in his research, the doctor tells everyone that as long as he cures Fenster, he will be able to receive a grand prize in the field of medicine, which will be the honor of the whole town as well.\n\nThe crazy nobody suddenly becomes the rockstar of the town. The whole town sticks together and forces Fenster to accept Quince's treatment. They confine Fenster and burn that old book before him.\n\nOut of everybody's surprise, Fenster breaks free and reaches out to save the book. He gets burned all over in the end and becomes hardly recognizable. In his moment, they see that Fenster is beyond redemption, so they leave him alone and move on to looking for another patient they can trade for honor. The next day, Fenster is missing, leaving behind a note that claims he has found the path to the dream world of the book and is already there.\n\nSome say Fenster was having an illusion before death. Others doubt that the world he said might exist. Nobody knows where he went or if he's still alive. The Civil Town's last book disappears along with him. All they can expect is the arrival of another crazy guy.			
7	1	—Eventually, Robots Have Their Own Planet Too—	"Robert was a companion robot that almost got retired for it had failed a quality examination due to missing parts. Before it got recycled, the family couldn't let go of it and decided to step in. They signed an agreement to acquire Robert's ownership rights and made it stay with them. Robert then witnesses the growth of the kid of the family. Due to its defect, Robert is not able to help its little master to learn, but the little master always tells every story she heard to Robert.\n\nThe little master has great enthusiasm for astronomy, telling Robert about one galaxy after another. Lives in the universe can be divided into groups by planet with different creatures living and prospering on their home planet. Meanwhile, each planet has a dominate species who determines the direction of the planet's civilization development. On Earth, it's human beings. On Oceanana, it's sea creatures. On Foresta, it's plants... It seems that every species can find a planet belongs to it.\n\n""What about robots? Is there a planet for us too?"" Robert asks awkwardly. Due to its worn-out speaker system, it takes him some time to finish.\n""I don't know—we have no evidence of a planet like that so far."" The little master waits patiently for Robert to finish and answers its questions carefully, as always.\n""But just because there's no evidence doesn't mean there is no such planet! Perhaps it's too far away. Perhaps it hasn't grown up yet.""\n""Robert can wait until someone discovers it. Robots lives way longer than humans. Robert can surely make it until that day.""\n""When that day comes, Robert can live in a place full of robots.""\n""Robert doesn't want to go there. Robert is fine staying at home.""\n""Humans have short lives. After we are all gone... it will be Robert's home.""\n\nRobert doesn't understand. Why would its masters be gone one day? Is it because they will scrap it just like the recycling station guys? However, it doesn't bother Robert much as long as it gets to stay with this family a few more days before that.\n\nLater, the little master grows up, ages, and dies. Robert realizes that instead of ""getting scrapped,"" humans ""die."" After the entire family pass away, the government recycle the house and properties. Robert begs the officers to keep everything as it is for it will always stay here.\n\n""Robots have no rights over the property."" The officers tell this little old robot.\n""Then let me have that album. Only that album. I want to record everything I remember about this family on it. Please.""\n""You should have records in your storage device. That'll be enough. Only civilizations have the privilege to memories. You robots don't have such thing.""\n\nHow could it be? Robert remembers how the family laughed, cried, and every moment it spent with them. But the little master said only ""records"" leave traces of existence, so Robert doesn't insist. Instead, it embarks on a journey to look for civilizations. Civilizations—Civilizations—\n\nIf Robert found a civilization of his own, would he finally have the right to record his memories?\n\nBecause of this, Robert waits and waits. It tries to optimize its performance and meets friends who want to join it. Years later, they finally find a planet with no civilization at all and settle down on it. No one will chase them away or take away their rights. Robert can finally record all the memories about that family.\n\nEventually, robots too have their own civilization.\nEventually, robots too have emotions.\nEventually, robots too have a planet that belongs to them."

35	1	Asparagus Cultivation Methods and Considerations	Soil Requirements: Prefers warm and humid environments. Likes sunlight, tolerates partial shade, but fears direct strong light. Please use the sandy loam soil provided by the Science Council and ensure the weather system data in the transplant area is adjusted to the recommended parameters.\nCare Method: Asparagus has fleshy roots and fears waterlogging, so daily watering should not be excessive. Fertilize regularly during the vigorous growth period. Babylonia's Endangered Plant Management Department will uniformly arrange watering and fertilization for all registered vegetation. Please do not care for plants yourself.\nPropagation Method: Asparagus propagation mostly uses the division method, requiring comprehensive consideration of season, temperature, growth years, and plant size. If you have propagation or division needs, please report to Babylonia's Endangered Plant Management Department, and professional staff will assist with the process. Do not do it by yourself.\nIn case of questions, please contact Babylonia's Endangered Plant Management Department.			
36	1	Communication Guide and Social Crisis Observation Manual	"Social Crisis Episode 3: Occasions for Apology\nNow that you've learned how to communicate sincerely, but what is the right occasion to apologize?\n\nKey Point One: The Right Time\nA time that makes both parties feel comfortable and relaxed can ease negative emotions and help you better convey and understand each other's feelings.\nFor example, during the artificial sky's dawn-dusk transition period, the artificial weather system adjusts the main lighting to twilight mode, creating gentle illumination and a comfortable ambient temperature.\nIf needed, you can access the weather system's simulated atmospheric optical logs to check simulation dates for different sunset types. Rainbow sunset, cirrus cloud sunset, and dramatic fiery sunset are all excellent choices.\nPlease express your apology and feelings in a comfortable and relaxing atmosphere.\n\nKey Point Two: The Right Place\nA location suitable for private conversation that isn't crowded or noisy can help both parties think independently and face each other sincerely.\nBabylonia's cafes, bookstores, and green areas with natural plants as barriers are all private spaces. If you choose a rare vegetation transplant area, you might even have the chance to hear chirping insects, flowing water, and other white noises that mimic the natural environment on the ground.\nRumor has it that the Endangered Plant Management Department is planning to transplant a genetically modified medicinal plant whose caffeic acid can oxidize and release light energy under luciferase catalysis, producing a soft cold glow. If successful, it will likely spark a new photo-taking trend.\nWithout the interference of noises, please face the issue bravely and sincerely resolve the misunderstanding and conflict between you.\nOf course, most importantly, remember what we've learned before—don't fear communication, don't fear responsibility, don't be stingy with promises, and always trust each other.\nFinally, here's to our success!\n\nAfterword\nAccording to books from the Golden Age, humans are inherently social creatures, building our civilization through communication and cooperation.\nPeople live within the relationships they forge with one another, and these bonds subtly nurture humanity in return, shaping the world around us.\nWe have surrendered our lives to war's uncertainty. Beyond flesh and honor, the only thing that remains is what makes this world beautiful and what makes it absolutely impossible to abandon—something that binds all existence together, allowing breath, heartbeat, electromagnetic fields, and consciousness to achieve resonance.\nIt possesses tremendous power, yet remains restrained and gentle.\nIt drives us to seek life or embrace death, to communicate and connect, to save and sacrifice, to grasp another's hands and draw close to another heart.\nWe give it a name—""love"".\nThe lost song from the Golden Age sing thus—in the end, the love you receive will equal the love you have created.\nLet's raise our glasses to this! In this age, blood still runs warm and algorithms remain gentle."
