1	101	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Commandant, please allow me to remind you that each operation is accompanied by a variety of missions.		2		
2	101	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	After completing the mission, you will receive a large number of supplies. Please make sure that you collect them in time.		3		
3	101	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	This will help us acquire advanced equipment earlier, which will be useful in future operations.		4		
4	101	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Let us do so next.				
5	102	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Commandant, thanks to everyone's hard work, I can finally rejoin the fight!		6		
6	102	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Before that, please upgrade and tune me, then assign the battle position for me.		7		
7	102	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Commandant... I can't wait to fight alongside with everyone together.				
15	105	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Commandant. The Constructs have their own military ranks.		16		
16	105	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	It not only symbolizes honor, but raising their ranks will also increase their performance.		17		
17	105	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Complete specific missions to promote a Construct.		18		
18	105	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	I look forward to bringing honor to the team, Commandant.				
19	1	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Commandant, battles can be long and difficult. In return for your daily efforts...		20		
20	1	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Signing in will earn you supplies every day! They will help you in your journey.		21		
21	1	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	The supply center has prepared a special weapon for you as your first sign-in reward.		22		
22	1	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Gray Raven will always be with you, Commandant!				
23	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Commandant, you should have your own mission board, right?		24		
24	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	In addition to your main missions, there are daily missions that can be completed for that day.		25		
25	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Don't underestimate these mission rewards!		26		
26	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Now, let's take a look at the mission board.				
27	3	1	???	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Yahoo! Do you remember who I am?!		28		
28	3	1	???	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	I knew you'd remember! I mean... when we first met.		29		
29	3	1	???	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	It's okay if you forgot. You'll remember soon enough, because we're about to fight side by side!		30		
30	3	1	???	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	The supply center has prepared R&D Tickets for you. Go to claim them!				
32	111	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	As battles get more difficult, we need to ensure a steady flow of supplies.		33		
33	111	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Keep it up and complete your major missions.		34		
34	111	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	This will ensure that we have enough resources as our enemies get tougher.		35		
35	111	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Let's strive for humanity together, Commandant.				
36	106	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Outside of main missions, you can also have your Constructs take part in training programs.		37		
37	106	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Training allows us to gain experience in simulation battles.		38		
38	106	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Please remember to schedule training sessions for us in the future.				
39	4	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	A new support squad has arrived in the region, Commandant. They are eager to meet with you.		40		
40	4	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	In addition to delivering supplies, they will also trade resources with you.		41		
41	4	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Let's try trading something with them.				
47	107	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Commandant, are you running into skill point shortage issues when trying to upgrade Construct skills?		48		
48	107	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Battle Exercises are a great way to get more skill points.		49		
49	107	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Try it out if you need them.				
50	108	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	These cogs contain an important material used in our Construct frames.		51		
51	108	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	A lot of cogs are required to extract enough materials to upgrade our frames.		52		
52	108	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Cogs can be found in many places, especially in Cogs Galore.				
53	6	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Commandant, our equipment are made from special materials.		54		
54	6	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Upgrading them requires the same special materials.		55		
55	6	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	We can find these upgrade materials from Logistics Maintenance.				
56	7	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Commandant, equipment eventually reaches a point where they can no longer be upgraded.		57		
57	7	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Overclock materials are required to enhance them further.		58		
58	7	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	This will allow you to enhance equipment to a higher level.		59		
59	7	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	You can get Overclock materials from Military Hardware.				
64	9	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Commandant, do you remember the battles that you participated in?		65		
65	9	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	You usually only get to see one side of the story.		66		
66	9	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Over time, however, records from other sources become available.		67		
67	9	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Essentially, you have the chance to observe what happened from another perspective.		68		
68	9	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	So, let's trying replaying the past, shall we?				
69	109	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Once we're familiar with the tactics of a particular operation...		70		
70	109	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	The risk of battling becomes greatly reduced. This enables the Auto Clear feature.		71		
71	109	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	This allows us to complete familiar missions without the need of your command.		72		
72	109	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	This way, you'll be able to focus your attention on more important missions.				
73	10	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	High-rank Memories are important to improving the combative capabilities of a Construct.		74		
74	10	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	The more difficult the Combat Supply mission, the higher the chance to get high-rank Memories.		75		
75	10	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Now, let's try more difficult missions to test the limits of the squad!				
76	11	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Greetings, Commandant of the Gray Raven squad!		77		
77	11	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Curious about me?		78		
78	11	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	We all have our own personal files.		79		
79	11	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	You may learn a thing or two about us Constructs when you look through them!				
80	112	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	We meet again, Commandant of Gray Raven.		81		
81	112	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Have you noticed that you now have access to the Trial Zone?		82		
82	112	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	The Trial Zone offers the opportunity to try out various prototype projects under development...		83		
83	112	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	... or, depending on the perspective, practical tricks by the research team.				
84	12	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	More and more Constructs have joined our team.		85		
85	12	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	You can view your Construct roster and status on the Construct Army page.		86		
86	12	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Reach Construct development milestones to get special materials.		87		
87	12	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	I'm sure you'll find them useful...				
88	13	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	Here's a message for you, rookie.		89		
89	13	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	There have been sightings of very powerful Corrupted.		90		
90	13	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	You should not attempt to combat these powerful foes on your own.		91		
91	13	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	Join a Co-op operation to prove your ability to work with others.		92		
92	13	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	I have high expectations for you, Gray Raven.				
93	110	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Most operations often involve multiple squads.		94		
94	110	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	You can request assistance from other squads before a battle.		95		
95	110	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Try issuing a call for Constructs from other squads.				
96	14	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Commandant, remember Mr. Hassen's tip?		97		
97	14	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	The more you know, the more decisions you face.		98		
98	14	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	As your relationship with Constructs improves, you will be able to access more of their personal files.		99		
99	14	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Let me give you some advice. As you learn more about their past...		100		
100	14	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Make sure you treasure your present and future with them.				
101	15	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Commandant, we have received a new coating from HQ.		102		
102	15	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Coatings are purely cosmetic and do not affect Construct performance.		103		
103	15	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Um... Commandant, would you like me to put on a new coating?				
104	16	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Let's do some bounty missions, Commandant!		105		
105	16	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Oh, right. I need to explain them to you.		106		
106	16	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Completing bounty missions will earn your team a lot of experience.		107		
107	16	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	But more importantly, bounty hunting sounds real cool!				
108	17	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png					
109	18	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Commandant, the Dormitory is finally open!		110		
110	18	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	This symbolizes that we are ready to take root on Earth for the long haul.		111		
111	18	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	I'm looking forward to living in the dorms with everybody!		112		
112	18	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	You can also modify and upgrade the Dormitory.		113		
113	18	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	I'm sure you'll make it a great place!				
114	19	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	Which would you prefer, competition or cooperation?		115		
115	19	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	Whether for honor or for resources, everything in the War Zone is earned through competition.		116		
116	19	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	Earn a high enough rank to access a new War Zone...		117		
117	19	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	...Which will grant even better rewards.		118		
118	19	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	This is the ultimate trial ground for Gray Raven. How far can you go?				
119	20	1	Nikola	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NikelaNomal01.png	Good. I was worried that you won't pick up the receiver.		120		
120	20	1	Nikola	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NikelaNomal01.png	I've been analyzing Gray Raven's battle logs.		121		
121	20	1	Nikola	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NikelaNomal01.png	It looks like those special enemies have been giving you a hard time.		122		
122	20	1	Nikola	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NikelaNomal01.png	I'm giving you permission to use the training facilities to simulate training against these special enemies.		123		
123	20	1	Nikola	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NikelaNomal01.png	Get used to fighting them quickly, because enemies will only get tougher.				
124	21	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	Are you as curious about this world as I am, Commandant of Gray Raven?		125		
125	21	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	I long to return to Earth as much as you do, even though I was not born there.		126		
126	21	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	There are so many secrets waiting to be discovered in the wastelands...		127		
127	21	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	If you're interested, I can tell you about some... special places that we've found.				
128	22	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Greetings, Commandant. You now have access to the Medal system.		129		
129	22	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Medals are issued to those who have contributed to the cause of the United Human Front. You can find yours in the Central Database.				
130	23	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Thanks to your hard work, Babylonia is able to establish a foothold on the ground.		131		
131	23	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	This is a new start for us, so here comes your next mission.		132		
132	23	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	"You're about to head to the ""Reconstruction Zone"" located near the safe zones."		133		
133	23	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Eliminate all the remaining enemies and restart the Central Purification Filters, so our Engineering Force can start their work.		134		
134	23	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	I'll cover more detail after the Central Purification Filters are completed.				
135	555	1	Nikola	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NikelaNomal01.png	I want to talk to you about Gray Raven's recent performance.		136		
136	555	1	Nikola	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NikelaNomal01.png	Your recent performance has been exemplary, and you have earned the medal of Ace Commandant.		137		
137	555	1	Nikola	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NikelaNomal01.png	With achievement also comes expectation. I look forward to your next victory.		138		
138	555	1	Nikola	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NikelaNomal01.png	I've sent you the certification link. Go ahead and claim your medal!				
139	556	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	It has been a long time since I've seen so many dots on the monitor. These dots represent the bases of humanity.		140		
140	556	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	You've completed the mission successfully. And your contributions to Babylonia are well-noted.		141		
141	556	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	I hereby issue you the Medal of Pioneers in recognition of your achievements. I look forward to your future endeavors!		142		
142	556	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	Go, claim this medal of glory now.				
143	557	1	Nikola	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NikelaNomal01.png	Hmph, you are full of surprises.		144		
144	557	1	Nikola	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NikelaNomal01.png	It's been a long time since I last saw a commandant reach 1 million Progress. You were only a little slower than my performance when I was young.		145		
145	557	1	Nikola	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NikelaNomal01.png	You should be proud of it. It's an exclusive club of two.		146		
146	557	1	Nikola	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NikelaNomal01.png	You are now authorized for the medal. Claim it now!				
147	558	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	This is the 9th liberation report from you. It seemed like an eternity ago that you and your team fought in your first battle...		148		
148	558	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	You and your Constructs have grown into a true team, a bright beacon in the darkness. Your companions also indicate your strength.		149		
149	558	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	Here is the Medal of Light Tower in honor of your achievements as the guiding light of humanity.		150		
150	558	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	Now share the joy with your comrades!				
151	559	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	I've seen you overcome many challenges in your path.		152		
152	559	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	The path of leadership that you walk brings back many memories.		153		
153	559	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	On behalf of the United Humanity Front, I hereby issue to you the Medal of Human Leader.		154		
154	559	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	From now on, your duty is not to earn the approval of others, but to bring them hope and point them towards the future. See you on the bridge.				
155	599	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Congratulations on the capture of City 015, Commandant. The Engineering Force is already on its way to repair the city's Central Purification Filter.		156		
156	599	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Be careful, however, as there are still pockets of Corrupted on the outskirts.				
157	600	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	A small step for your team, a great step towards victory over the Punishing Virus.		158		
158	600	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	Gray Raven's efforts have led to the full retreat of the Ascendant from this city, as well as the establishment of our first major base on Earth. I look forward to your future performance.				
159	601	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	You have not only recaptured a base for humanity, but also preserved the artifacts of the museum. Good job.		160		
160	601	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	The Archaeological Team sends their regards. We'll make sure that you're rewarded!				
161	602	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Good job completing your mission in the harsh environment of the desert.		162		
162	602	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	We've struggled to make headways in this region for a long time, now, we've finally established a foothold here thanks to you. The work of Babylonia can finally be carried out smoothly.				
163	603	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	The data that you obtained from the test area are of great... historical importance to the development of M.I.N.D. technology.		164		
164	603	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	I thank you on behalf of the education center under the Science Council.				
165	604	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	I'm sure you understand that details regarding the Luna City Arsenal are classified.		166		
166	604	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	That's why we're not in a position to hold a public award ceremony for you.		167		
167	604	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	Still, you should know that we appreciate your work.				
168	605	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	The murals... Sagemachina... interesting.		169		
169	605	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	Your capture of these ruins allows us to investigate them up close. Good job.				
170	606	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	Taking back the space station means a lot to the security of the surroundings of Babylonia in future.		171		
171	606	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	On behalf of Babylonia, I would like to thank you for your outstanding contribution. I look forward to your return.				
172	607	1	Jamilah	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/JiamilaNormal01.png	Looks like it went well.		173		
173	607	1	Jamilah	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/JiamilaNormal01.png	I knew you could do it.		174		
174	607	1	Jamilah	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/JiamilaNormal01.png	By the way, have you considered our offer? Akdilek would be pleased to have you join us, anytime.				
175	608	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal01.png	Many thanks for your assistance.		176		
176	608	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal01.png	The problems here are mostly resolved. The ship will now sail to the right direction.		177		
177	608	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal01.png	But nobody knows what awaits us at the destination...		178		
178	608	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal01.png	Whatever. It was you who brought us the opportunity to change. Thanks!				
179	609	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	Good to see you back.		180		
180	609	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	Humans suffered quite a loss this time, but it's okay. Because I still see hope in your eyes.		181		
181	609	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	Alright, we still have lots to do, but you should take a good rest now.		182		
182	609	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	There's someone waiting for you, don't forget.				
183	700	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Thanks for spending time with them.		184		
184	700	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	We've been able to enjoy the holidays thanks to you.		185		
185	700	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Have a good rest. I've prepared a little gift for you back at HQ. Check it out later!				
186	701	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	I've never been part of an event like this... It feels a little strange.		187		
187	701	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	But I enjoy seeing the smile on everybody's faces.		188		
188	701	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Here's a little gift. I hope you like it.				
189	702	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Hey, Commandant, guess what I have for you?		190		
190	702	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	It's my special New Year present!		191		
191	702	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Wait, where did it go? I thought I put it in my bag...		192		
192	702	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Did I already send it out? Let's go take a look!				
193	703	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Happy New Year, Commandant.		194		
194	703	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Thank you for all that you've done this past year.		195		
195	703	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	May the next year be just as productive.				
196	704	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Commandant, Commandant! Happy New Year!		197		
197	704	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Miss me already?		198		
198	704	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Guess what, Nanami's got a New Year present for you!		199		
199	704	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Happy? Like it? This is the part where you praise Nanami!				
200	705	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	It was quite a surprise when you asked me to come over for Spring Festival.		201		
201	705	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	But I really enjoyed it!		202		
202	705	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Here's a little something in return.		203		
203	705	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Keep it a secret between us, ok?				
204	706	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	I'm definitely not saying that I enjoyed Spring Festival with you guys!		205		
205	706	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	I'm just saying that if you're gonna have a party, you need fireworks!		206		
206	706	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	Luckily for you, I've got them prepared.		207		
207	706	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	And since it's boring to watch fireworks by myself, I'll let you watch them together with me.				
208	24	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	Alright, the regular update is complete. Everyone is dismissed. Commandant, please stay for a moment.		209		
209	24	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	So let's get down to business on Camu.		210		
210	24	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	As you may already know, Camu's body and mind are very special, and he is more suitable to fight in areas with high concentration of Punishing Virus.		211		
211	24	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	According to preliminary research by the Science Council, Camu is able to perform missions in areas inaccessible to ordinary constructs.		212		
212	24	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	I hope you can continue to connect with him remotely when fighting in high concentration areas—take care of him.				
213	800	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	I've already uploaded today's battle data analysis report onto the system. Once we've collected enough data, I'll hand in a Construct refinement report to the Council.		214		
214	800	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Upgrading a Construct's frame needs to be done with extreme caution. The process requires constant optimization and fine-tuning. It's not something that can be done in a day, but the wait is worthwhile.		215		
215	800	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	This is the end of today's report... By the way, I found out that today is a celebration in the west back in the Golden Age where... people gave gifts to those dear to them.		216		
216	800	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Don't get me wrong, I just think that celebrations are a core part of humanity, and for a certain someone to miss out on this important event would be... unfortunate.		217		
217	800	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Which is why, in order to make sure you don't miss out, I'll... always be here by your side, celebration or not. Happy Valentine's, KURONAME.				
218	801	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Commandant, today is a very important day in the Golden Age western culture, do you know what it is? It's the day of love!		219		
219	801	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Back in the Golden Age, people on Earth would give chocolates to the people they love, and the streets were filled with happy couples.		220		
220	801	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	...I feel happy just thinking about it. I hope the world will be filled with love again once we reclaim Earth.		221		
221	801	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	I wanted to experience it too, so I made some chocolates...		222		
222	801	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	If it's not too much, will you accept these, Commandant?				
223	802	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Commandant! Happy Valentine's Day! I read that on Valentine's Day, you confessed your love. In the visual nov... I mean, the information I found! Valentine's Day is the day you spend with the most important person in your life!		224		
224	802	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	And to me, that person is, of course, you, Commandant! Am I your most important person too, Commandant? I am, right? Right?		225		
225	802	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Hehe, anyway, I've prepared Valentine Serum chocolate for you! I've put tons of sugar in it. Nothing says Valentine's Day like it, right?		226		
226	802	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	If you have time... could you come to my room tonight... I found a fighting game popular during the Golden Age! You're gonna love it! We can play it all night long!				
227	803	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Commandant, for all the times we've gone through, thank you for your leadership and guidance... Why did I say these things?		228		
228	803	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	...According to the information of Golden Age festivals, today is the day where people expressed their feelings to their beloved with chocolate as a gift. Is it correct?		229		
229	803	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	I see, so the information is true... You haven't misunderstood. Commandant is no doubt the one I like.		230		
230	803	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	I've prepared hand-made chocolates for you. But I'm not... very familiar with this. I promise I will work harder on it, Commandant.		231		
231	803	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Happy Valentine's Day, Commandant.				
232	804	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Hey hey! It's Nanami! Commandant, do you know what day it is today?		233		
233	804	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Yep! It's Valentine's Day! Do you feel your heart is racing a bit faster?		234		
234	804	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Speaking of Valentine's Day, chocolate is the thing we definitely can't miss!		235		
235	804	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Ms. Celica said if there is a very very important person to you, you have to make a very very yummy chocolate as a present. So Nanami has spent a whole night... or two days... a long time anyway, to make this!		236		
236	804	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	You have to enjoy it slowly! Nanami won't allow you to swallow it in only one bite!				
237	805	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	I hope I didn't catch you at a bad time, Commandant of Gray Raven.		238		
238	805	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	According to the database, today is a vital western festival during the Golden Age, Valentine's Day.		239		
239	805	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	On this day, people used to make chocolates that contained their feelings and give it to the person who was important to them.		240		
240	805	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	If you don't mind, please accept this. I don't know if you like sweets or not... but I hope you will like it.		241		
241	805	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	...Happy White Day, KURONAME.				
242	806	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	What? I couldn't care less about this boring festival.		243		
243	806	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	But, well, since you look forward to that, I've prepared chocolates for you, just because I don't want to let you down.		244		
244	806	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	Hmph, they're not exquisite, but I'm sure they will impress you!				
245	807	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	Commandant! Happy Valentine's Day! On this day, what cannot be missed is chocolate!		246		
246	807	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	Hehe... Look! Special chocolate made by me! The proportion of sugar, milk and cocoa is 1:2:4, which is a golden formula showed in Golden Age movies! Also I've used solidified serum jelly as stuffing!		247		
247	807	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	By the way, this serum is slightly different. After all... we've shared some mutual secrets, right?		248		
248	807	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	What? Have I tasted it before? How could I taste it before you do? It's a big gift to KURONAME!				
249	808	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	BZZZZ—Can you hear me? The signal here's a bit unstable... What's with that face? You worried about me? As you can see, there's nothing to worry about. I'm fine.		250		
250	808	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	This is for you, made with raw dark chocolate and Serum. I used to eat this kind of chocolate in the army all the time to refresh myself.		251		
251	808	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	Yeah, I made it. What? It's not that hard to make chocolate... Why am I giving you chocolate? Do you really need me to explain?		252		
252	808	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	Happy Valentine's Day. I'll be waiting for you outside Oasis later. You're worried about me, right? Then come see for yourself that I'm fine.				
253	809	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	*WARNING! The communication channel has been hacked! Please disconnect it immediately!*		254		
254	809	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	This is for you.		255		
255	809	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	I'm sure you won't feel alone today as you have Gray Ravens by your side.		256		
256	809	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	But still... Happy Valentine's Day.				
257	900	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Happy Children's Day, Commandant of Gray Raven.		258		
258	900	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Speaking of which, why do I still have to work today?! Am I not eligible? Don't you think I should have a day off?		259		
259	900	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Whatever, I've finished my work. How about I go have some fun at your dormitory? Don't tell President Hassen!		260		
260	900	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	I'll go get some balloons and candies. See you later!				
261	1010	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	I found this flower during one of the missions. After looking up the database, I realized it was from the same taxonomical family as the one you gave me.		262		
262	1010	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Seeing this flower... made me think of someone. Such coincidence was an extremely rare event, statistically.		263		
263	1010	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	To me, it was of significant value for research... I preserved it, so I could give it to the person it led me to.		264		
264	1010	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	According to the data from Golden Age, flowers had a language of their own. So... here's my reply to you.				
265	1020	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Commandant, everybody told me to come here because I got a gift from you before. What did they mean by that?		266		
266	1020	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Are you trying to tell me something? Sorry I can't hear you, you're stuttering quite a bit.		267		
267	1020	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Just say it. I'll remember everything you say. Anything.				
268	1030	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Commandant, I planted this rose myself...		269		
269	1030	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Sorry that I never told you about this. I just wanted to give you a surprise today...		270		
270	1030	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	But I never thought that you would give me a flower first.		271		
271	1030	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Thank you... I'm so happy.				
272	1040	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	Commandant, as a leader, you should manage your work-life balance.		273		
273	1040	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	Seeing your white rose reminded me of what other team members said about this day.		274		
274	1040	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	This is a day you'd want to spend with your dream partner...		275		
275	1040	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	I've brought you this rose in the hope that it would bring you my most sincere prayers and wishes.				
276	1050	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Oooh? FOR ME?		277		
277	1050	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Nanami's so glad! I hope you're as glad as I am!		278		
278	1050	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Let Nanami see... Ahah, there it is!		279		
279	1050	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Ta-da! Take it, Commandant! It's one of Nanami's best stuff!				
280	1060	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Commandant, you copy? This is Kamui from an encrypted private channel. Make sure you listen to this! *Beep—*		281		
281	1060	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Hey, Commandant, you busy? It's been a while since we last spoke!		282		
282	1060	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	It's White Day today! You sent me flowers, didn't you? I'm the only one to receive your gift of love, right?		283		
283	1060	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	I'm so happy! Commandant, I've got something for you too! See, I went to the park and picked the most beautiful rose there!		284		
284	1060	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	So, will you come and find me on White Day every year? It's a deal then! I'll always be waiting for you!				
285	1070	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	Pah, knew you'd be drowning in your reports in the office. Hey, you don't have anything else on, do you?		286		
286	1070	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	No? Good...		287		
287	1070	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	Why am I sitting on a sofa all of a sudden?		288		
288	1070	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	I sit where I want to sit!		289		
289	1070	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	By the way... You're free tonight, aren't you? Silence is compliance!				
290	1080	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	Morning, Commandant. How's work? I just... got your gift.		291		
291	1080	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	Such a gift on such a day... Are you trying to tell me something?		292		
292	1080	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	Well, in that case... Just remember to check your mailbox later.		293		
293	1080	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	If you like it, I'll take you to the sea of flowers the next time you come to Oasis.				
294	1090	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LuxiyaNormal01.png	Commandant, here's my gift for you in return. I'm not very good at this, so please forgive me if you don't like it...		295		
295	1090	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LuxiyaNormal01.png	But I will keep trying... To become your weapon that can cut through all the obstacles, and... to become the best Construct in your mind.				
296	1100	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LifuNormal01.png	Commandant, you don't have to do this.		297		
297	1100	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LifuNormal01.png	I love the flowers, but what I really want is...		298		
298	1100	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LifuNormal01.png	To have you by my side.				
299	1110	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LiangNormal01.png	I found this rose in some ruins during a mission long ago.		300		
300	1110	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LiangNormal01.png	It was so beautiful. According to the database, on certain important dates, people in the Golden Age would give such flowers... to their important ones.		301		
301	1110	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LiangNormal01.png	I recorded all its data, including the angle of every single petal, in my M.I.N.D. so I could restore it. It is the only rose I have stored in my M.I.N.D... And I hope you can see it too.				
302	1120	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LifuNormal01.png	Commandant, thanks for your rose. I love it.		303		
303	1120	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LifuNormal01.png	Actually... I have a little surprise for you too.		304		
304	1120	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LifuNormal01.png	Can you come to the deck of Babylonia later?				
305	1130	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3ShenweiNormal01.png	Hey, Commandant, you busy? Mind if I spare some of your time?		306		
306	1130	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3ShenweiNormal01.png	I got your gift, so I was wondering if I should do something to return your favor. How about I give myself to you... Joking! Hehe.		307		
307	1130	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3ShenweiNormal01.png	Anyway, I've got a little surprise for you, and you only! Don't tell anyone else!		308		
308	1130	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3ShenweiNormal01.png	Make sure you take good care of it! I want to stay with you forever, just like this gift.				
309	1140	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3KalieninaNormal01.png	What? You should've expected me today when you gave me that last month.		310		
310	1140	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3KalieninaNormal01.png	So what's with this stupid outfit? You look miserably clueless!		311		
311	1140	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3KalieninaNormal01.png	Whatever, just give me your hand. Don't you know how to hold hands?		312		
312	1140	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3KalieninaNormal01.png	O-oi, don't grab me all of a sudden! Don't use so much force, you dumbo!				
313	1150	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3Yongyechaonormal01.png	I'm back! It's a me! Na☆na☆mi!		314		
314	1150	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3Yongyechaonormal01.png	Why didn't you tell Nanami earlier?! Do you know how difficult it is to take this out?		315		
315	1150	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3Yongyechaonormal01.png	I had to return to the lab within 15 sec, then smash—I mean borrow the liquid nitrogen container, and rush back here!		316		
316	1150	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3Yongyechaonormal01.png	Let me think... You shall have a one-day date with Nanami as punishment!				
317	1160	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	Waiting for me...? Guess not. Whatever.		318		
318	1160	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	I never thought you would care about such a date in Babylonia.		319		
319	1160	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	Honestly, that gift of yours wasn't very useful. In other words, I didn't like it.		320		
320	1160	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	If you are ever going to give me something again... Just pack yourself up and come to the Ascendant's base.				
321	1170	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3DubianNormal01.png	Commandant, it's been a while. How have you been?		322		
322	1170	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3DubianNormal01.png	I found a rose in an abandoned base while patrolling. I didn't know why, but you were the first thing that came to my M.I.N.D... So I brought it back in the hope that you would like it.		323		
323	1170	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3DubianNormal01.png	Then I saw your gift. You were thinking exactly what I was thinking, weren't you?		324		
324	1170	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3DubianNormal01.png	I have put your rose in a vase. Hope I can see you before it withers, if possible.				
325	1180	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2ErrorNormal01.png	Happy White Day, Commandant! I didn't expect to get a gift from you.		326		
326	1180	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2ErrorNormal01.png	Ah... What I mean is, I'm actually very happy.		327		
327	1180	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2ErrorNormal01.png	"Because it was the first time that I got such a valuable gift. Well, Commandant, are you ready for my ""real gift""?"				
328	1190	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3BiankaNormal01.png	Thanks for your gift, Commandant.		329		
329	1190	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3BiankaNormal01.png	"By the way, ""314 Days With You"" just hits the theaters today. Let's watch it together."		330		
330	1190	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3BiankaNormal01.png	And... There's something I want to tell you too.				
331	1200	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	So this is true...		332		
332	1200	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	This is for you.		333		
333	1200	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	I heard today was a day to exchange gifts with important ones.		334		
334	1200	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	I spent a lot of time preparing this.				
335	1210	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	Incoming communication from Strike Hawk—Chrome's dedicated channel.		336		
336	1210	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	Commandant of Gray Raven, please, allow me to call you by your name this time.		337		
337	1210	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	KURONAME, I have received your gift. I don't know if I understood your intentions correctly...		338		
338	1210	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	"Speaking of roses, I wonder if you have ever heard of ""Unter der Rose""—"		339		
339	1210	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	I know this may not be allowed, but I want to be there with you.				
340	25	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Oh, you've already received the mission details, haven't you?		341		
341	25	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	"Codenamed ""Operation Guardians"", it's a regular patrolling mission that requires all commandants' participation."		342		
342	25	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	It aims to help commandants get accustomed to the Earth's environment and secure the safety of each conservation area.		343		
343	25	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	The details will be provided once you get there. The transport of equipment and personnel is ready now.				
344	901	1	POD	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PodNormal01.png	The integration compilation of the four unnamed records has been completed and the final hidden record has been exported.		345		
345	901	1	POD	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PodNormal01.png	This hidden record has unknown network connection performance and signs of data disorder, and reading may cause additional risks.		346		
346	901	1	POD	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PodNormal01.png	"After all, it is just the record of ""others""."		347		
347	901	1	POD	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PodNormal01.png	"If read, it means a connection with ""others"" would form, resulting in unpredictable consequences."		348		
348	901	1	POD	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PodNormal01.png	Even so, will you try to read the final hidden record?				
349	2001	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Everyone says today is a special day, but there's no official record of it in my database.		350		
350	2001	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	White Day...? This is the first time I've heard of it.		351		
351	2001	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Although I can't fully comprehend the meaning behind this festival, I understand that it's a day you spend with someone you like.		352		
352	2001	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	I appreciate that you're willing to spend the day with me, even when it's unrelated to any mission.		353		
353	2001	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	You won't have to ask me—I'll always follow you, Commandant, as one of the Gray Ravens.				
354	2002	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LuxiyaNormal01.png	I'm not particularly perceptive about this, so I wanted to check with you again, Commandant.		355		
355	2002	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LuxiyaNormal01.png	Did you want me to visit Venus Splash Park with you because it is White Day today?		356		
356	2002	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LuxiyaNormal01.png	Ah, I see... and I thought I was here as a bodyguard.		357		
357	2002	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LuxiyaNormal01.png	Regardless, I'm glad that I'm more than just your blade on the battlefield, Commandant, and that I can accompany you on a day like this.				
358	2003	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R4LuxiyaNormal04.png	Commandant, thank you for accompanying me on this special day.		359		
359	2003	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R4LuxiyaNormal04.png	I had a really good time. I'll keep this feeling of happiness forever in my M.I.N.D. so that I'll never forget it.		360		
360	2003	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R4LuxiyaNormal04.png	You have always been the person I care... and respect the most, Commandant. It was you who made me understand that I'm more than just a weapon.		361		
361	2003	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R4LuxiyaNormal04.png	I hope that I get to spend every White Day with you like today in the years to come.				
362	2004	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	*WARNING! The communication channel has been hacked! Please disconnect it immediately!*		363		
363	2004	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	Have you been waiting for me to call again?		364		
364	2004	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	Even with all those around you, you're still choosing to spend today with me. Do you understand what it implies?		365		
365	2004	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	Are you that lonely...? Huh, or were you worried that I'd be alone? Such unfounded concerns.		366		
366	2004	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	Stop worrying about these meaningless things. Unlike you, I enjoy my solitude. You should be more concerned about yourself instead of me.				
367	2005	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	The report on Venus Splash Park's restoration was uploaded to the Science Council. It seems that the Engineering Force hasn't been slacking.		368		
368	2005	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Construction on the essential conservation area settlement is 72.5% complete. Apart from that, repairs on recreational facilities are 45% complete, somehow. I can't say if the Engineering Force is efficient or if there is just a high demand for that kind of facility.		369		
369	2005	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Why are you looking at me like that... Let's be clear—I'm here at the Venus Splash Park with you to collect data. That's all.		370		
370	2005	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Fine... Of course I know what day it is today. As I told you before, festivals are humanity's shared memories. I wouldn't want to miss any of them, essential or not.		371		
371	2005	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Including today. Understand?				
372	2006	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LiangNormal01.png	Are you going to bed already? That's fair. You've been out having fun the whole day, after all. It's about time you get some rest.		373		
373	2006	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LiangNormal01.png	I've just performed maintenance on my frame and cleaned out the salt and sand in my joints.		374		
374	2006	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LiangNormal01.png	I told you not to run around on the beach. Had you not dived into the waves, I wouldn't have needed to get you back and...		375		
375	2006	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LiangNormal01.png	Your behaviors are giving me a headache… I looked happy? I wasn't... I only went in because I didn't want my commandant washed away by the waves. That's all.		376		
376	2006	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LiangNormal01.png	Forget it. You won't listen no matter what I say. It's a special day today, after all, so I'm glad you had fun.		377		
377	2006	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LiangNormal01.png	Good night, and... Happy White Day, Commandant.				
378	2007	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Commandant, thank you so much for taking me to the Venus Splash Park on White Day...		379		
379	2007	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	I'm glad I got to spend time being close to you.		380		
380	2007	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	...Sorry, it's... embarrassing to say it out loud.		381		
381	2007	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Commandant, you must be tired now. Please rest up. I'll leave you be.				
382	2008	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LifuNormal01.png	Happy White Day, Commandant.		383		
383	2008	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LifuNormal01.png	Spending today at Venus Splash Park with you... was the best day I've had in quite a while.		384		
384	2008	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LifuNormal01.png	I would have spent more time with you, Commandant, but there are only so many hours in a day... It's time for you to rest.		385		
385	2008	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LifuNormal01.png	Every moment with you is a miracle for me. I'll keep these memories in my journal.				
386	2009	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LifuNormal01.png	Commandant, are you going to rest? I'm still unpacking the gifts you gave me today, but I'll be with you shortly.		387		
387	2009	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LifuNormal01.png	I didn't want to bother you with unnecessary calls, but there are things I just cannot say in person...		388		
388	2009	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LifuNormal01.png	Thank you very much for taking me to the Venus Splash Park on this special day, Commandant. Maybe you didn't realize… but for me, it meant a lot...		389		
389	2009	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LifuNormal01.png	I'm almost done with my things. I'll be there soon, Commandant.				
390	2010	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Commandant! Happy White Day! Hehe... Of course I know it is White Day today! I knew I had triggered... something important when you came to me!		391		
391	2010	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	So you took me to Venus Splash Park because you selected my route? Regardless, my route for you has never changed!		392		
392	2010	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Did you enjoy today, Commandant? Have I picked the best options to increase my Affection?				
393	2011	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3ShenweiNormal01.png	You seem happy today, Commandant. You haven't stopped laughing... Because of me? I told you I'd keep smiling for you as long as you like.		394		
394	2011	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3ShenweiNormal01.png	Did you take me to Venus Splash Park today to cheer me up? Here I thought it was because it's White Day today... Ah! You must know what it is, Commandant!		395		
395	2011	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3ShenweiNormal01.png	See, you know it... So can I call it a date? It was a date! Crap—now I have to play a few rounds of fighting games to calm down! Yep! Sounds good! Good night, Commandant!		396		
396	2011	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3ShenweiNormal01.png	I'm not inviting you to my room to play with me. You are not staying overnight! Why? Because I want to wake up early and see you well-rested and energized!				
397	2012	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	Commandant, the female members of the force just reminded me that it is a special day today.		398		
398	2012	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	I'm sorry I didn't realize what day it was. I was wondering why you invited me to Venus Splash Park with you.		399		
399	2012	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	No, you didn't keep away from any of my work. I finished them in advance in order to join you. I should thank you for having me.		400		
400	2012	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	White Day... I've been told it's connected to Valentine's Day. How are they connected?		401		
401	2012	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	Please tell me more if you don't mind. I would love to keep listening to you talk, Commandant.				
402	2013	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3BiankaNormal01.png	White Day...? No, I didn't know about it.		403		
403	2013	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3BiankaNormal01.png	I only learned about Valentine's Day from the database not too long ago, so I wasn't expecting a day for people to reciprocate a month later. So this is what it's for... Good. I get it now.		404		
404	2013	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3BiankaNormal01.png	Offensive? No, it's not offensive. It may not be my idea of a traditional festival, but the meaning of a festival has always been given by the people who celebrate it.		405		
405	2013	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3BiankaNormal01.png	The important thing is how people view it now. The time I spent with you today has been fulfilling and endearing, and that's good enough.				
406	2014	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	Hey! What took you so long to answer?! Were you drifting off?!		407		
407	2014	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	Answer my call immediately next time, do you hear me?! Don't make me wait! What? You're tired?		408		
408	2014	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	Tch! Turns out the Gray Raven Commandant is so weak and puny. We only walked around Venus Splash Park today, and you're already exhausted?		409		
409	2014	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	...Tch. Then get your *** to bed already... What?! I wasn't worried! I—WAS—NOT!		410		
410	2014	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	But now that you've answered my call... Happy... White... Day. What?! **** you! I thought that was what... Whatever! Get out of here!				
411	2015	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3KalieninaNormal01.png	You answered me right away. You've been waiting for my call, haven't you?		412		
412	2015	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3KalieninaNormal01.png	What the ****? Why aren't you resting now that you're back? Do I need to remind you of something like this?!		413		
413	2015	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3KalieninaNormal01.png	Don't get me wrong! I wasn't being worried. Who else is going to the water fight with me on a day like this if you're too tired to go?		414		
414	2015	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3KalieninaNormal01.png	What the hell are you waiting for... I'm going to hang up!		415		
415	2015	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3KalieninaNormal01.png	Tch—Fine! Happy White Day! Are you happy? GO—TO—BED—RIGHT—NOW!				
416	2016	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Ta-da! Nanami is BACK! I know we just parted, but do you miss me, Commandant? I know you do! Because Nanami is already missing you!		417		
417	2016	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	"Nanami had a great day today! I've always wanted to experience White Day, but none of my ""friends"" could accompany me on this special day."		418		
418	2016	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Not to mention that even Nanami knows that this isn't just a day you hang out with your friends!		419		
419	2016	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Promise me you'll take Nanami to celebrate different festivals like we did today, Commandant!				
420	2017	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3Yongyechaonormal01.png	Argh! Commandant! Why does it feel like years already when we've just parted?		421		
421	2017	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3Yongyechaonormal01.png	It must be because I lost to you in the Game Center earlier! No one ever beat me in a video game!		422		
422	2017	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3Yongyechaonormal01.png	So, when should we visit Venus Splash Park again? Nanami can't wait! I'd play games with you every day if I could, Commandant!		423		
423	2017	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3Yongyechaonormal01.png	Of course Nanami knows it is a special day today... But it doesn't matter what we do. It always feels like a date when Nanami is with you!				
424	2018	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	Thank you for today, Gray Raven Commandant. Venus Splash Park is indeed a nice place. Babylonia has done a respectable job turning it into a settlement.		425		
425	2018	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	If it is possible... I wish those abandoned and forgotten could visit this place.		426		
426	2018	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	Sorry for thinking out loud. I know you didn't invite me today for boring and serious discussions. I just never could stop thinking about them.		427		
427	2018	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	...Anyway, thank you very much for inviting me on a day like this. Little as it may be... it has changed how I see Babylonia.				
428	2019	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3DubianNormal01.png	Buzz—It's finally stable now. Can you hear me? It's me. I'm back at the Forsaken camp.		429		
429	2019	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3DubianNormal01.png	"My hair is messy? Oh, the children here ""robbed"" me when I got back. They're feasting on all the candies you gave me now."		430		
430	2019	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3DubianNormal01.png	Ha... I'm kidding. I knew you prepared the candies for them. My apologies—I know I don't act like this very often around you... I had a really good time today.		431		
431	2019	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3DubianNormal01.png	I still looked weighted down sometimes? I... I suppose I can't help worrying about my comrades even on a day like this.		432		
432	2019	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3DubianNormal01.png	However, when the children asked me about the date... I couldn't help remembering it fondly.		433		
433	2019	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3DubianNormal01.png	Perhaps contradiction is part of our nature. Anyway... Thank you for today. I look forward to... the next one.				
434	2020	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KuluomuNomal01.png	*Incoming communication from Strike Hawk—Chrome's dedicated channel.*		435		
435	2020	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KuluomuNomal01.png	You must be back by now, Gray Raven Commandant—I mean, KURONAME. I'm sorry to bother you at this hour.		436		
436	2020	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KuluomuNomal01.png	It's just that some feelings can only be shared after I carefully choose my words.		437		
437	2020	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KuluomuNomal01.png	I don't think I've misinterpreted why you invited me to Venus Splash Park today. It was my honor to spend the day with you.		438		
438	2020	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KuluomuNomal01.png	But next time, allow me to take the initiative.				
439	2021	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	I've shared with Jamilah what we did today.		440		
440	2021	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	Jamilah told me to thank you again. That's why I'm calling you.		441		
441	2021	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	Thank you, KURONAME. I don't quite understand what it means, but I know that today is special.		442		
442	2021	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	All I know is... I enjoy being with you.				
443	2022	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	When will you stop playing house? Did you think you can get rid of me by taking me to a park?		444		
444	2022	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	How presumptuous of you. Am I such an impressionable idiot in your eyes?		445		
445	2022	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	What? Did you say I looked happy today? Ha—have you forgotten what I put you through already, Gray Raven Commandant? How dare you speak to me like that?!		446		
446	2022	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	What you did today hasn't satisfied me at all. I'm a lot more greedy and predatory than you think. I'll take more and more... You get it, Commandant.				
447	2023	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	I hate these boring festivals, and I hate that boring park. I especially hate going to that park on one of those festivals. What? Do you take me for a child?		448		
448	2023	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Why did I stay if I found them boring? What a stupid question! I was there to keep an eye on you! You were so excited that I thought you'd have jumped off the Ferris wheel if I weren't paying attention.		449		
449	2023	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Besides, if it weren't for the fact that you were kind of interesting among all this boring nonsense, I would've been gone already.		450		
450	2023	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Don't deal with me the way you deal with Kamui. I'm not that idiot. I always know what I want, KURONAME.				
451	2024	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	I couldn't believe how big the difference was between the arctic and tropical regions. I was shocked by the heat when I arrived at the park.		452		
452	2024	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	While the arctic is still covered in ice, there's another part of the world that's bright and warm.		453		
453	2024	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	There were no howling winds or blizzards. The Forest Guards are not afraid of the cold, but to find places where fires are not needed for warmth... It's incredible.		454		
454	2024	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	Huh? Today is... White Day? It's the first time I've heard of it... But doesn't White stand for the snow in the arctic?				
455	2025	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal01.png	Did you bring me there today to show me what Babylonia is capable of? Ha. It's nothing compared to what Kowloong can do...		456		
456	2025	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal01.png	No? You took me there because... it's White Day today? What's that?		457		
457	2025	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal01.png	How dare you?! That is no joking matter! There isn't such a festival in Kowloong, so it's understandable that I'd know nothing of this foreign tradition.		458		
458	2025	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal01.png	"But I see what it could represent... If this day matters so much to you, I'll wish you a ""Happy White Day""."		459		
459	2025	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal01.png	That place was so noisy and crowded. I do not hate a metropolis, but some words are not meant to be said in a place like that.		460		
460	2025	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal01.png	Not that I mind someone keeping me company...				
461	2026	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	Hehe, KURONAME, look... That's right. These are the coins I won at Game Center!		462		
462	2026	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	It's the first time I see so many coins in one bucket. I bet I'm a billionaire now... What? I can't use these coins outside the Game Center?		463		
463	2026	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	How can this be... I was going to use them to buy a gift for you in return...		464		
464	2026	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	Forget it. At least I'm still the richest one in the Game Center. So, when are you going to the park with me again? I'll give you half of my coins!				
465	2027	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	Should I take today as a gesture of goodwill?		466		
466	2027	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	What you offered today was indeed wonderful. But time passes; festivals will be forgotten and parks will decay. Everything we have now is but a meaningless and fleeting gasp before we reach our end.		467		
467	2027	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	To be, and then to perish, that is the world, for better or worse.		468		
468	2027	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	If you expect the same, I'm willing to make this gasp last a little longer.				
469	2028	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	Happy White Day! Commandant!		470		
470	2028	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	Of course I remember this special day! Didn't you take me to Venus Splash Park because of it?		471		
471	2028	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	I enjoyed spending the day with you, Commandant! The blue ocean, yellow sand, and white clouds... Thank you for gifting me so many colors and inspirations.		472		
472	2028	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	I've decided to paint everything I saw today on my canvas right now... Of course, the most essential color is you!		473		
473	2028	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	I wish you could become a color that only I can use all the time. It is said that artists who excel with a color can name it after themselves...		474		
474	2028	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	But I will give you that right instead. Then, you'll be able to stay on my easel... and with me.				
475	2029	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	……Hello? Can you hear me? Hold on... Ahem…		476		
476	2029	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	My apologies. I'm still not used to communicating through comms, but there is something I feel like I must tell you today face-to-face with my voice.		477		
477	2029	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	I had a wonderful day. Thank you for taking me to a dream that has yet to yield to reality, KURONAME.		478		
478	2029	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	I couldn't help but wish it were summer... But spring is also full of life, and this ocean feels like summer all year round.		479		
479	2029	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	So allow me to conclude this call by adapting a line from one of my favorite poems––		480		
480	2029	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	Shall I compare thee to a spring's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate, but thy eternal summer shall not fade, KURONAME.				
481	2030	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	Hello? Are you back yet? Are you going to bed? Um... I've lain down in the maintenance room already.		482		
482	2030	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	I'm getting ready to enter the sleeping pod. I'm just checking in with you before I go to sleep... Somehow, I can't sleep well without giving you a call.		483		
483	2030	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	The things we did today took so much energy... How strange it is that I feel like I'm in a weightless dream when I'm with you, but exhaustion surges up once we're apart, as if I'm waking up.		484		
484	2030	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	Yawn... Boggles my mind. I'm going to have a nice, long sleep now. Perhaps in my dream, I can stilll... hmm... Never mind.		485		
485	2030	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	Well, then... Happy White Day. Good night, KURONAME.				
486	60001	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R4LuxiyaNormal04.png	Commandant, I heard today is the day that we are supposed to send gifts to the special people in our lives on this special day, aren't we?		487		
487	60001	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R4LuxiyaNormal04.png	I found this rose on the battlefield. I... want to give it to you.		488		
488	60001	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R4LuxiyaNormal04.png	I've combed through some data, and this rose turns out to be pretty ordinary. You can even find it on Babylonia.		489		
489	60001	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R4LuxiyaNormal04.png	But... it's beautiful. It's such a common sight it's easy to forget that, but that won't change what it is. It is beautiful, isn't it?				
490	60002	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	Finally online. You've kept me waiting, Gray Raven Commandant.		491		
491	60002	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	I noticed the gift you sent over. A rose. How fascinating.		492		
492	60002	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	You have to know that they come with thorns, right?		493		
493	60002	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	Stay where you are. Yes. There. Now.		494		
494	60002	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	If you insist on screwing around with roses, don't be surprised when they decide to return the favor.				
495	60003	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Kamui mentioned that you humans give each other presents today.		496		
496	60003	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	And it's not about the gift, but the thought behind it? Well, this is what I think about the most.		497		
497	60003	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Take this. I spent some effort gathering all these snacks for you.		498		
498	60003	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	But be careful what you're chomping down. I've hidden something that you won't find until you finish them all.				
499	60004	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	It's customary for the Forest Guard to return the courtesy when we receive a gift.		500		
500	60004	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	Therefore, I'm giving you this rose I picked near our campsite as a token of gratitude.		501		
501	60004	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	Because of the different environment, it might not be as beautiful as the roses you find in other regions.		502		
502	60004	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	But we Forest Guards admire what it represents—to resist the winter cold until spring dawns.		503		
503	60004	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	I hope this flower and I can both bring you solace during difficult times, as we await a better future together.				
504	60005	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	I've received... your gift.		505		
505	60005	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	"It seems that, despite geographical variations, it is part of human nature to set a date for ""celebration."""		506		
506	60005	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	That said, I can see your sincerity in the gift you gave me. I'll consider adding this record to Tabula Akasha.		507		
507	60005	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	...Still unsatisfied? Then I'll give you a gift in return... as a memorial of this day?				
508	60006	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	Hey, Commandant! I've got your gift. As I thought, you really know what day it is today!		509		
509	60006	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	I know many interesting festivals, but this is the best among the best 'cause I can get a gift from Commandant!		510		
510	60006	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	Hehe, it is courteous to give something back in return after you receive a gift, isn't it?		511		
511	60006	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	See! I've already got it prepared. Don't you worry that I will forget your kindness!				
512	3001	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Do you have time at the moment, Commandant?		513		
513	3001	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	...Nothing special. It's just I want you to have this tutorial CD.		514		
514	3001	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	...Do I know what day today is? Ahem, I just randomly grabbed it. It's not something I specially prepared.		515		
515	3001	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Of course this is to prevent you from imposing unreasonable demands on me. I can't conjure up anything out of thin air anytime and anywhere, Commandant.		516		
516	3001	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	You didn't answer my question. Do you have time now?		517		
517	3001	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	About the weapon extension add-on module you asked about... I researched on it a bit. Find me in the lounge if you still want it.				
518	3002	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LiangNormal01.png	Do you have time at the moment, Commandant?		519		
519	3002	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LiangNormal01.png	...Nothing special. It's just I want you to have this tutorial CD.		520		
520	3002	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LiangNormal01.png	...Do I know what day today is? Ahem, I just randomly grabbed it. It's not something I specially prepared.		521		
521	3002	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LiangNormal01.png	Of course this is to prevent you from imposing unreasonable demands on me. I can't conjure up anything out of thin air anytime and anywhere, Commandant.		522		
522	3002	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LiangNormal01.png	You didn't answer my question. Do you have time now?		523		
523	3002	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LiangNormal01.png	About the weapon extension add-on module you asked about... I researched on it a bit. Find me in the lounge if you still want it.				
524	3003	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	White Day is a special day. I've noted it down.		525		
525	3003	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	I prepared a different gift for this year's White Day than last year.		526		
526	3003	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	I heard that people in the Golden Age used it to store videos. It's a bit outdated, but I still like it a lot.		527		
527	3003	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	If you don't mind, Commandant, shall we record something for our memory?				
528	3004	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LuxiyaNormal01.png	White Day is a special day. I've noted it down.		529		
529	3004	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LuxiyaNormal01.png	I prepared a different gift for this year's White Day than last year.		530

531	3004	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LuxiyaNormal01.png	If you don't mind, Commandant, shall we record something for our memory?				
532	3005	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	Another meaningless gift... You are hopeless.		533		
533	3005	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	Alright. I guess I'll have to give you something in return.		534		
534	3005	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	I happened to have recorded something boring. Hmm... I think it's okay to let you have a look.		535		
535	3005	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	I can get you down here from Babylonia if you want to see it with your own eyes.				
536	3006	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R4LuxiyaNormal04.png	White Day is a special day. I've noted it down.		537		
537	3006	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R4LuxiyaNormal04.png	I prepared a different gift for this year's White Day than last year.		538

540	3007	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	The day has arrived again, Commandant.		541		
541	3007	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	I've been thinking about what I to give you...		542		
542	3007	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	I remember you said you want to learn to sing...		543		
543	3007	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	So I put the practice videos on this CD without your permission.		544		
544	3007	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	H-hope it can help you, Commandant!				
545	3008	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LifuNormal01.png	The day has arrived again, Commandant.		546		
546	3008	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2LifuNormal01.png	I've been thinking about what I to give you...		547

552	3009	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LifuNormal01.png	I remember you said you want to learn to sing...		553		
553	3009	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LifuNormal01.png	So I put the practice videos on this CD without your permission.		554		
554	3009	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LifuNormal01.png	H-hope it can help you, Commandant!

561	3011	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	I don't know why, but every time I watch this movie, it always reminds me of you, Commandant.		562		
562	3011	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	I'll let you have the soundtrack of the movie. And if possible...		563

591	3018	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	Cough cough... Forget about the dust. Tell me, Commandant, am I the first to communicate with you?		592		
592	3018	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	It doesn't matter even if I'm not the first one, but at least I'm earlier than Lucia, right?		593		
593	3018	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	Be patient with me, Commandant. My gift is almost done... What did you say? I didn't hear it! Huh? This is just a small explosion! It's not a big deal!		594

600	3020	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	I've received your gift, Commandant. Long time no see.		601		
601	3020	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	I read your letter and appreciate your concern for the Forsaken.		602		
602	3020	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	Everything is fine at the Oasis. It's just the kids are always asking about you.		603		
603	3020	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	Nights in the desert are dark and long.		604		
604	3020	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	You would have feelings that you never had when looking up at the starry sky.		605		
605	3020	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	If you have time, may I invite you for a visit to the Oasis?

612	3022	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	Happy White Day, Commandant!		613		
613	3022	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	It's said that it's a day to express love.		614		
614	3022	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	Although it is a convention passed on from the Golden Age, it remains a commonplace practice for everyone to celebrate.		615		
615	3022	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	Thank you for the gift, Commandant! In return, I'll let you have the best work of mine!		616		
616	3022	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	Do you like it, Commandant? Because you've got a pretty smile on your face! Yeah, just like that! Cheese! Just look forward to my new work, Commandant!				
617	3023	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	Um... I've been looking for a suitable return gift after receiving your gift.		618		
618	3023	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	But Jamilah told me that a handmade gift is the best way to convey my feelings. Plus, it saves money.		619		
619	3023	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	It's my first time recording a video like this. And I just noticed that there were a lot of things I didn't know about Akdilek.		620		
620	3023	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	Remember to hang out with me if you will visit Akdilek again in the future.				
621	3024	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	Sorry for the late reply. Maybe I tend to think too much like the way I play chess.		622		
622	3024	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	In the end, I realized that I had so many things to tell you that I didn't even know where to start.		623		
623	3024	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	This video records games among chess masters. I often find myself lost in watching it as if I could hear the masters' laughter when they play chess.		624		
624	3024	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	Maybe for them... and for us, chess is a better way of expression than words.

629	3026	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	You won't please me with this, Commandant.		630		
630	3026	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	Bring me something more valuable if can, for example...		631		
631	3026	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	Huh? Are you asking for a gift from me? Hahaha, I love your stupidity.		632		
632	3026	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	To thank you for making me laugh... I think I'll just give you a little reward in return.		633		
633	3026	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	But I require more in return. You understand me?				
634	3027	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WeilaSNormal01.png	You won't please me with this, Commandant.		635		
635	3027	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WeilaSNormal01.png	Bring me something more valuable if can, for example...		636		
636	3027	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WeilaSNormal01.png	Huh? Are you asking for a gift from me? Hahaha, I love your stupidity.		637

639	3028	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	Greetings, Commandant.		640		
640	3028	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	It's been a long time since I came to Babylonia.		641		
641	3028	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	But sometimes I wonder if there would be a day that we can walk on the white snow, travel under the aurora, and take a simple trip at a silent lake.		642		
642	3028	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	... Perhaps it's not the time to think about the future, but I've prepared a gift.		643		
643	3028	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	Even though I'm not lucky, I still hope that we can make use of this gift in the future.				
644	3032	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	Morning, Commandant. Hehe.		645		
645	3032	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	Today is an auspicious day. According to the calendar, it's a good day to give gifts!		646		
646	3032	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	Do you consider bartering? We're a small business, and I'm an honest businessman...		647		
647	3032	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	Don't hang up, Commandant! At least take my gift!		648		
648	3032	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	You scared me, Commandant. I'll be mad at you if your gift is not good enough!				
649	3033	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	... Why are you giving me a gift again?		650		
650	3033	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	This is meaningless, or are you expecting an agent to respond to you?		651		
651	3033	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	Fine. Just this once. I'll give you what you want.				
652	3034	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	Commandant, good morning, or evening.		653		
653	3034	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	Hff... Your gift has woken me up.		654		
654	3034	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	I heard it was a gift from the Gray Raven Commandant and now I'm not sleepy at all.		655		
655	3034	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	What's so special about today?		656		
656	3034	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	Great. I remember you said you sometimes have trouble sleeping.		657		
657	3034	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	Sleeping pills are not good. Take this CD. It will help you with your sleep... I've been wanting to give this to you.		658		
658	3034	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	Come to me any time if it doesn't work. I have many other ways to treat insomnia.				
659	3035	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/21haoNormal01.png	No. 21 wants to share something with you, Commandant.		660		
660	3035	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/21haoNormal01.png	According to the documentary, animals will share their food with their companions.		661		
661	3035	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/21haoNormal01.png	Although this is not food and No. 21 doesn't eat.		662		
662	3035	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/21haoNormal01.png	No. 21 wants to share its collection with you.				
663	3036	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Today is the day to exchange gifts, right?		664		
664	3036	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Don't listen to such boring music. It will weaken your mind.		665		
665	3036	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	I'll let you have this. Feel the real rock spirit of the Golden Age.		666		
666	3036	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Classic music in there. Don't lose it. Otherwise...				
667	3037	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	I'm almost used to this new way of celebration.		668		
668	3037	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	You're getting better at picking gifts.		669		
669	3037	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	"Good job. ""A young man worth teaching"" in the old Kowloong language."		670		
670	3037	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	Take this. After feeling the brilliance of Kowloong, you will change your mind and might even carry on Kowloong's will with me.				
671	3038	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	I'm like an alone cloud, floating high above the valleys. Suddenly, I see a sea of flowers. The golden daffodils are in full blossom on the ground...		672		
672	3038	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	This is the first part. How do you like it, Command?		673		
673	3038	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	I added my own melody to it. And the inspiration came from the echoes of the collision between the distant past and the present...		674		
674	3038	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	I hope it can add some colors to this never-ending illusion.				
675	3039	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal07.png	I'm like an alone cloud, floating high above the valleys. Suddenly, I see a sea of flowers. The golden daffodils are in full blossom on the ground...		676		
676	3039	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal07.png	This is the first part. How do you like it, Command?		677		
677	3039	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal07.png	I added my own melody to it. And the inspiration came from the echoes of the collision between the distant past and the present...		678		
678	3039	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal07.png	I hope it can add some colors to this never-ending illusion.				
679	3040	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	Oops, sorry, I accidentally pressed the communication button.		680		
680	3040	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	So, are you happy today? My dear Commandant?		681		
681	3040	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	If not, please accept this humble gift Roland prepared for you on this special day.		682		
682	3040	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	Ah, Commandant, did you really prepare a gift for me? This is really... unexpected.		683		
683	3040	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	"Well then, according to the etiquette of Babylonia, cough... ""I, Roland, would like to thank you for your friendship. I will spare no effort to support your effort to reclaim Earth..."""				
684	3041	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal04.png	Commandant! Thank you for your gift! Pulao feels sooo happy!		685		
685	3041	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal04.png	Actually, I have prepared you a gift as well, Commandant!		686		
686	3041	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal04.png	Ta-da! A super interesting anime! I found it on the market! Let's watch it together, Commandant!				
687	3042	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	Gift received from Commandant.		688		
688	3042	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	According to the information in the database, now it's the time to give Commandant a gift in return.		689		
689	3042	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	Gift-picking principle: pick a gift that the recipient likes and reflects the sender's characteristics.		690		
690	3042	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	"Gift picked. ""Send a gift in return"" set as the system's top priority."		691		
691	3042	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	... Yes, even without referring to the data, this is still something... I want to do this moment.				
692	3043	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal03.png	Commandant! Happy White... Happy everyday!		693		
693	3043	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal03.png	Cough cough... Forget about the dust. Tell me, Commandant, am I the first to communicate with you?		694		
694	3043	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal03.png	It doesn't matter even if I'm not the first one, but at least I'm earlier than Lucia, right?		695		
695	3043	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal03.png	Be patient with me, Commandant. My gift is almost done... What did you say? I didn't hear it! Huh? This is just a small explosion! It's not a big deal!		696		
696	3043	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal03.png	My gift is definitely gonna be more breathtaking than Lucia's, no, more breathtaking than anyone else's!				
1033	3044	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NuoanNormal01.png	Since you have come to meet me today as promised, I'll hold up my end and give you the deleted footage.		1034		
1034	3044	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NuoanNormal01.png	But... you looked tired when you arrived. Are you still this busy lately?		1035		
1035	3044	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NuoanNormal01.png	This heap of problems isn't created by one person. Just because they are assigned to you doesn't mean they're your sole responsibility.		1036		
1036	3044	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NuoanNormal01.png	Growing up in solitude might bring you merits but also vices... Lean on the people around you a little more, Commandant. Rely on me a little more.				
1037	3045	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	Bambinata has received the gift and will pass it to Mistress safely, Commandant... Huh? It's for Bambinata?		1038		
1038	3045	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	Please wait, Commandant. Bambinata is checking the reminder module.		1039		
1039	3045	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	Ah... Today is the day people exchange gifts with those who are important to them. The notification module of Bambinata's reminder system was damaged, and…		1040		
1040	3045	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	…Sincerest apologies, Commandant. Bambinata should have prepared a gift for you on this important day, but Bambinata has forgotten about the promise...		1041		
1041	3045	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	I-if you don't mind, Commandant, Bambinata would love to make it up to you in other ways...				
1042	3046	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V220hyNormal01.png	Got through? I'm glad to meet you again, Commandant.		1043		
1043	3046	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V220hyNormal01.png	The connection between us is not always good, which means it's lucky for us to be able to speak on such an important day. This is what people call fate, I guess?		1044		
1044	3046	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V220hyNormal01.png	Anyways, I would like to thank you for the gift. I like it. And I also want to give you a gift in return.		1045		
1045	3046	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V220hyNormal01.png	It's a Kowloong cooking book with many classic Kowloong recipes. I know Babylonia's pre-made food is enough to fulfill your daily nutritional needs, but the pleasure of cooking for yourself is different.		1046		
1046	3046	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V220hyNormal01.png	The connection won't hold much longer. Anyways, I hope you can take good care of your health. Eat properly, and rest properly.				
697	113	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Commandant, Liv of Gray Raven reporting for duty.		698		
698	113	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	I can't wait to fight alongside with everyone together.				
701	115	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	As battles get more difficult, we need to ensure a steady flow of supplies.		702		
702	115	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Please lead us to acquire the materials we need from different operations.		703		
703	115	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	This will ensure that we have enough resources as our enemies get tougher.		704		
704	115	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Let's do our best together, Commandant! Gray Raven will always be with you!				
705	116	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Good day, Commandant of Gray Ravens. I've got good news for you today.		706		
706	116	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	The combat-assisting drones developed by Babylonia have been officially put into use!		707		
707	116	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	I believe they will be of great help to you in your upcoming battles.				
708	117	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Hey, Commandant of Gray Ravens. How's the mission going?		709		
709	117	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Feeling a little bit lagging behind?		710		
710	117	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Then you might be interested in F.O.S. Military Command College's special collaborative programs for new Commandants.		711		
711	117	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	I believe they'll help you make a giant leap forward.				
712	118	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Now that the world is plagued by the Punishing Virus.		713		
713	118	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	To respond to different crises, we need to gather our power.		714		
714	118	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Only by standing together can we save the world from catastrophe.		715		
715	118	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	More details will be provided when other commandants are present as well.

722	3101	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Is that what you've been staying up late for? I should've known this when I saw the empty cells on the schedule. It's just I never imagined I was the recipient.		723

743	3104	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	We've had a lot of inspections lately, but nothing else. Don't worry.		744		
744	3104	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	I prepared it in a hurry. It's said that the silk cotton flowers in bloom look like burning flames and have been known as a symbol of heroism among people. I thought they fitted you well. Do you like them?		745		
745	3104	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Commandant... I miss everyone...		746

809	3116	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Why I chose them as the gift...? Well, they all came from different stars. Holding them in your hands is like holding the universe and the stars in your hands.		810		
810	3116	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	This way, every time when I look up into the starry sky, I will think of the stars in your hands... Don't you think it's super romantic?

824	3119	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	These are not just ordinary stickers. You can only get one of these by winning the Gold Trophy in the game. Now they are all yours!		825

826	3119	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Some trophies require a team of two...		827

854	3124	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	This living stone is a desert specialty. It's a symbol of unyielding spirit.		855

862	3126	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	Sad news! Commandant, my agent took away the gift you gave me! She said for the sake of my public image, I shouldn't accept everything sent to me...		863		
863	3126	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	But the good news is that I've taken it back from her, and my gift to you is ready. You should have it now.		864		
864	3126	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	I planted this peony secretly in a corner of the greenhouse after joining the WGAA. Growing flowers is way boring than painting, but that's what makes us appreciate their beauty more when they bloom.		865		
865	3126	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	I want to share this feeling with you, so I keep some seeds. Let's plant flowers next time.		866		
866	3126	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	By the way, I made that black card specially for you, so keep it well.		867		
867	3126	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	I'll let you know what you can trade it for later.		868		
868	3126	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	Why not now? Because my agent has found out that I got the present back, I'm on the run!		869		
869	3126	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	Well then, see you, Commandant!

878	3128	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	Did you make the gift yourself, Commandant?		879		
879	3128	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	Well then, I'll have to thank you with a gift.		880		
880	3128	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	Jamilah said flowers were the best in this case... So I want to make the flowers I grew into a bouquet and give it to you.		881

898	3131	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	But I'm not in a good mood. And I don't have the time to fight with you. Come to the business district. I need me to do me a favor. You're the only one who can help me with it.		899		
899	3131	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	Why? Well... Because some salesman wouldn't stop bothering me until I bought what he was selling.		900		
900	3131	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	I can't use it, so I was going to throw it away... But that guy started to doubt if I had no body to give it to.		901		
901	3131	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	So I need you to get here in ten minutes. I wonder what expression that guy will have when he sees our hero Commandant is the recipient... You won't refuse it, would you?

907	3133	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	Commandant, thank you for the gift. I wonder... if you're available today?		908		
908	3133	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	"I went to Babylonia's market for the first time... Ah, the ""shopping street"" you often say."		909		
909	3133	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	I was stopped by an old lady. She said she's a psychic and wanted to do a reading for me.		910		
910	3133	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	The result is... not bad actually. It seems that I'm not always that unlucky. But she told me that if I could come again with a person I care today, it would bring good luck to both of us.		911		
911	3133	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	That's why... I messaged you. And about my present, did you receive it? It would be great if you have it.				
912	3134	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	It's the time of year again. Let me think. What did I get you last year?		913		
913	3134	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	I was planning to send you some food, but the cargo crews were not here. What a shame...		914		
914	3134	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	But we passed through Kowloong a few days ago. I didn't go in there, but it was nice to look at it.		915		
915	3134	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	This is Bai Zhi. Um... You've never heard of it? You could only find it in Kowloong, and only people there can recognize it.		916		
916	3134	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	Wait! Why did the repair team give you the photo of me repairing the vehicle? Damn...				
917	3135	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	You should have received it by now.		918		
918	3135	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	This is a gift I prepared for you, plus a message I left.		919		
919	3135	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	The fact that you can see this message means that you're still living somewhere in this world.		920		
920	3135	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	If so, we'll meet again after I wake up.		921		
921	3135	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	That alone will be great, no matter what position we will be in at that time.				
922	3136	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	I didn't get the chance to say this in the morning... Thank you for the gift. I like the sound of it. I replaced the old dreamcatcher in my sleeping pod with it. I can see it as soon as I wake up.		923		
923	3136	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	In most cases, it's not hard to fall asleep, but it's hard to dream things we want to dream... After all, we can't control our dreams.		924		
924	3136	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	However, your gift might solve this problem... So I'm planning to... yawn... give it a try...		925		
925	3136	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	Have you opened my present? You can use those flowers as medicine. I guess you must be under a lot of pressure with all the work at hand. But you can also put them in a vase for decoration, of course...		926		
926	3136	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	Um... By the way, I remember you asked me why I found you so early before the mission today. I didn't have the time to explain it...		927		
927	3136	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	"... Because in addition to ""good night,"" I also wanted to say ""good morning"" to you in person."				
928	3137	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/21haoNormal01.png	Hmm... Give me 5 seconds.		929		
929	3137	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/21haoNormal01.png	Well, now, you should have my gift to you.		930		
930	3137	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/21haoNormal01.png	Why? I decided to prepare a gift for you first, so my gift should arrive first.		931		
931	3137	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/21haoNormal01.png	"Yeah. This is the bud ""Shrub"" gave me. She said it would bloom one day, and I've been waiting for that day."		932		
932	3137	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/21haoNormal01.png	It smells good, just like you. I would like you to have it.				
933	3138	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V23021Normal01.png	Hmm... Give me 5 seconds.		934		
934	3138	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V23021Normal01.png	Well, now, you should have my gift to you.		935		
935	3138	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V23021Normal01.png	Why? I decided to prepare a gift for you first, so my gift should arrive first.		936		
936	3138	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V23021Normal01.png	"Yeah. This is the bud ""Shrub"" gave me. She said it would bloom one day, and I've been waiting for that day."		937		
937	3138	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V23021Normal01.png	It smells good, just like you. I would like you to have it.				
938	3139	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	There's a new haunted house on the shopping street. Shall we give it a try...? Why do I have the tickets?		939		
939	3139	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Humph, I don't know what they were thinking, but they invited me to be their model at the entrance.		940		
940	3139	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Had it not been their super spicy staff meal...		941		
941	3139	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Anyways, those who got out look terribly scared. I guess the atmosphere must be pretty good in there.		942		
942	3139	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	You won't be scared with me by your side.				
943	3140	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	I have received your gift.		944		
944	3140	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	Did you make this music box yourself? It's delicate.		945		
945	3140	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	I have to send you a gift in return. This Yao Huang has been in a Kowloong courtyard for hundreds of years. It'll still be there for many more years.		946		
946	3140	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	When it dies, I will include all its data to Tabula Akasha.		947		
947	3140	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	And the sound of this music box should also be included in it.				
948	3141	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	Huh? The recording has already started...? Hff...		949		
949	3141	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	... Hello, Commandant.		950		
950	3141	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	I revisited the field of irises today. Walking among the flowers in full blossom reminded me of... the abundance of the world. It's incredible.		951		
951	3141	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	... I wonder what you would say if you were there. Yes, I was missing you at that moment.		952		
952	3141	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	I played my favorite song on the field and recorded it on the tape I found on my trip.		953		
953	3141	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	Hope you can hear it some day. All the best.		954		
954	3141	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	The aria has not completed yet, so please allow me use these words as a rest before we meet again.		955		
955	3141	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	"""You are the cosmos my heart has been longing for."""				
956	3142	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal07.png	Huh? The recording has already started...? Hff...		957		
957	3142	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal07.png	... Hello, Commandant.		958		
958	3142	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal07.png	I revisited the field of irises today. Walking among the flowers in full blossom reminded me of... the abundance of the world. It's incredible.		959		
959	3142	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal07.png	... I wonder what you would say if you were there. Yes, I was missing you at that moment.		960		
960	3142	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal07.png	I played my favorite song on the field and recorded it on the tape I found on my trip.		961		
961	3142	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal07.png	Hope you can hear it some day. All the best.		962

964	3143	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	Oh, I didn't expect to receive your gift on this special day as well.		965		
965	3143	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	Did you send it by mistake? Or are you trying to win me over with it?		966		
966	3143	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	Anyways, I've prepared a gift for you.		967		
967	3143	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	"An ancient Kowloong saying goes, ""A fake becomes real when you treat it as real."""		968		
968	3143	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	Then Commandant, could you guess if this gift is real or not?				
969	3144	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal04.png	Commandant! Do you have time after this...? I have a favor to ask!		970		
970	3144	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal04.png	Well, I know today is a holiday. I just haven't figured out what holiday it is.		971		
971	3144	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal04.png	But you have to spend on holidays. Everyone's gonna spend when they're happy!		972		
972	3144	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal04.png	So I bought various snacks, including salted plum candies, read bean cakes, hawthorn balls, walnut cookies, osmanthus cakes, and... But I got the number wrong by mistake...		973		
973	3144	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal04.png	I can't possible sell all of them! So I want to hold a big banquet. You have to come and help me finish them, Commandant!				
974	3145	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	Thank you for your gift. I've backed up the music date permanently in the memory chip.		975		
975	3145	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	Long ago, my creator asked me if machines could understand the feelings mankind convey through music.		976		
976	3145	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	Although I wasn't able to give him a certain answer on behalf of all the machines back then, for me... it gave me the happiness of putting my face against a furry animal's belly... No, I felt even happier than that.		977		
977	3145	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	My calculations tell me that the chance of you receiving my gift is 11.72%... But I believe, you'll definitely receive it.		978		
978	3145	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	"It combines function and beauty. Meanwhile, I tired to express my feelings through it. I did it without referring to any external data. It was entirely created by ""Haicma."""		979		
979	3145	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	Have a nice day.				
980	3146	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NuoanNormal01.png	Thank you, Commandant, are you always this good to the others?		981		
981	3146	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NuoanNormal01.png	Hm? Do I seem to care about it that much?		982		
982	3146	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NuoanNormal01.png	You're are right. Because I wanted you to keep a gift for yourself when sending the gifts out.		983		
983	3146	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NuoanNormal01.png	I'll let you have these blue throatwort flowers. Now we both have a gift.		984		
984	3146	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NuoanNormal01.png	As if there is any other reason that makes me care about it... How about I tell you next time when you visit me?				
985	3147	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	D-did you make it yourself...? Thank you.		986		
986	3147	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	The sound of the music box makes Bambinata feel nostalgic. Someone else once gave Bambinata a music box like that...		987		
987	3147	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	No, no, no... Bambinata is not comparing you with anyone! Your gift is special to Bambinata...		988		
988	3147	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	In return, please take these, Commandant. They've been improved. With proper temperature and humidity, they will bloom very soon…		989		
989	3147	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	Ah... right! Sorry... Bambinata's notes are in the box. Just throw them away if they get in the way.				
990	3148	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V220hyNormal01.png	Thank you, Commandant. I didn't expect to receive your gift at such a far away place.		991		
991	3148	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V220hyNormal01.png	As I told you before, I'm traveling around in Kowloong.		992		
992	3148	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V220hyNormal01.png	I'm standing by the river deep inside Kowloong. If you take a look, you could see the valley, the trees, and... me by the river.		993		
993	3148	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V220hyNormal01.png	It's strange that as a mechanoid, I shouldn't feel lonely, but I always think of your name at a time like this.		994		
994	3148	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V220hyNormal01.png	Although I can't share the scenery with you, I still hope we could enjoy it together one day.				
995	3149	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	Hahaha, why did you think I would leave a note asking you out for a duel at the theme park?		996		
996	3149	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	I'm done. So I'm a guy who's thinking about fighting all the time in your eyes...? Then I should reflect on myself... seriously...		997		
997	3149	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	I don't care if this is what other people think, but I hope you don't get me wrong, Commandant.		998		
998	3149	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	It took a lot of courage to write that note... But at least, we've cleared up the misunderstanding.		999		
999	3149	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	Then I'll handle the rest. Don't worry... No one knows theme parks better than me!				
1000	3150	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	Hey! That was lame, 21!		1001		
1001	3150	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	Why did it take you so much time to handle these minions?		1002		
1002	3150	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V23021Normal01.png	Noctis, that's my prey.		1003		
1003	3150	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V23021Normal01.png	Don't touch it. It's mine.		1004		
1004	3150	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	Huh, who cares about it...? Behind you!		1005		
1005	3150	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	Are you out of your mind? Watch your back! Don't make me take care of it for you.		1006		
1006	3150	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V23021Normal01.png	Hm... Thanks? Ugh, I don't like this.		1007		
1007	3150	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V23021Normal01.png	I let Noctis get the chance to help me...				
1008	3151	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WeilaSNormal01.png	Easy-peasy, all scums eliminated.		1009		
1009	3151	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WeilaSNormal01.png	How is it going with Noctis and No. 21? They should be able to handle it.		1010		
1010	3151	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WeilaSNormal01.png	Just send Noctis to the court-martial if anything goes wrong.		1011		
1011	3151	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WeilaSNormal01.png	Hah...		1012		
1012	3151	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WeilaSNormal01.png	Alright, let's just wait for them to come back.				
1013	3152	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WeilaSNormal01.png	Can you feel where Beardy is?		1014		
1014	3152	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V23021Normal01.png	Hmm... It's too far away.		1015		
1015	3152	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WeilaSNormal01.png	How about Noctis? Can you locate him?		1016		
1016	3152	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V23021Normal01.png	He's still within the range.		1017		
1017	3152	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WeilaSNormal01.png	Let's continue onward.		1018		
1018	3152	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V23021Normal01.png	Noctis has to pay me back for this one day.				
1019	3153	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	What the hell is this sandstorm?		1020		
1020	3153	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	I can't see anything! Hello? 21? Vera? Can anyone hear me?		1021		
1021	3153	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	Am I too far away from them...? But I can't go back.		1022		
1022	3153	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	Why do we have to save him...?		1023		
1023	3153	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	Damn, I have no idea. Perhaps we simply can't stand watching him die.		1024		
1024	3153	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	So... Spit... The sand...		1025		
1025	3153	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	Don't you dare to die.				
1026	3154	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	Can you just keep up, 21?		1027		
1027	3154	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	Don't tell me those claws are decoration!		1028		
1028	3154	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V23021Normal01.png	Shut up, Noctis!		1029		
1029	3154	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WeilaSNormal01.png	Hurry.		1030		
1030	3154	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WeilaSNormal01.png	We can get rid of these scums in no time.		1031		
1031	3154	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V23021Normal01.png	Prey... Prey. Why Noctis can't be prey?		1032		
1032	3154	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	Hey! Don't tell me that was not on purpose!				
1047	20001	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2110lnNormal06.png	Chess? The arrangement of these pieces doesn't comply with the rules.		1048		
1048	20001	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2110lnNormal06.png	My power is only enough to break the chesses, not enough to ruin the chessboard...?		1049		
1049	20001	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2110lnNormal06.png	"Well, then I guess I'll have to ""cooperate."""		1050		
1050	20001	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2110lnNormal06.png	...If there's anyone behind this, show me what else you have up your sleeve.				
1051	20002	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2110lnNormal06.png	It seems these are all the rules. Now—		1052		
1052	20002	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V210aefNormal01.png	...Luna?		1053		
1053	20002	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2110lnNormal06.png	Lucia?		1054		
1054	20002	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2110lnNormal06.png	Huh? There are also projections of things other than the chess?		1055		
1055	20002	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2110lnNormal06.png	No... Wait. It was you outside the chessboard. Were you attacked as well?		1056		
1056	20002	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V210aefNormal01.png	Just get used to it. We don't know who's the troublemaker this time.		1057		
1057	20002	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2110lnNormal06.png	This time?		1058		
1058	20002	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V210aefNormal01.png	...I felt something familiar just now... Maybe it was the one behind this.		1059		
1059	20002	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2110lnNormal06.png	I also want to know what the attacker is up to—but why are you outside the chessboard...?		1060		
1060	20002	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2110lnNormal06.png	And I can't break the barrier with my attacks.		1061		
1061	20002	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V210aefNormal01.png	Let me give it a try.		1062		
1062	20002	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V210aefNormal01.png	Tsk. Only some attacks worked.		1063		
1063	20002	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V210aefNormal01.png	There's no way to get out of here for now, but we can break the chess.		1064		
1064	20002	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2110lnNormal06.png	Let me take care of it, Alpha.		1065		
1065	20002	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2110lnNormal06.png	"Now that the ""special rules"" of this space have no limit on our strength, there's nothing to worry about."		1066		
1066	20002	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V210aefNormal01.png	Yeah. I will keep trying to break the barrier.				
1067	20003	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2110lnNormal06.png	Like this. Checkmate.		1068		
1068	20003	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V210aefNormal01.png	I have this feeling that someone more troublesome is coming.		1069		
1069	20003	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2110lnNormal06.png	"The enemy is getting stronger. Does it mean that we are close to ""victory""?"		1070		
1070	20003	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V210aefNormal01.png	But I still don't know who we are playing against.		1071		
1071	20003	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V210aefNormal01.png	Trouble.		1072		
1072	20003	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2110lnNormal06.png	Wanna have some rest, Alpha?		1073		
1073	20003	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2110lnNormal06.png	Speaking of which, I rarely beat you in chess even if I could change the rules as I liked when we were little.		1074		
1074	20003	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V210aefNormal01.png	Well, there's always a mysterious magic that makes you wanna play another round.		1075		
1075	20003	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2110lnNormal06.png	"Magic? I also feel something ""familiar"" now."		1076		
1076	20003	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V210aefNormal01.png	What traps us here might not come from anybody's will.		1077		
1077	20003	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2110lnNormal06.png	"This ""will"" is likely from the ""game"" itself."		1078		
1078	20003	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2110lnNormal06.png	Now that we know what that person's up to, let's hurry up and start the next round.		1079		
1079	20003	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2110lnNormal06.png	Whatever it is, we will keep winning it.				
1080	20004	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V210aefNormal01.png	I never thought we'd be playing against a program in this terminal.		1081		
1081	20004	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2110lnNormal06.png	The virtual space is gone, but the game in the terminal is still changing.		1082		
1082	20004	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2110lnNormal06.png	Well, we can start another round through the touch screen.		1083		
1083	20004	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V210aefNormal01.png	Wanna play a few more rounds?		1084		
1084	20004	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2110lnNormal06.png	This familiarity makes me feel comfortable. Chess is not a bad choice in terms of entertainment.		1085		
1085	20004	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2110lnNormal06.png	Wanna do this together, Alpha? Perhaps there's something more interesting.		1086		
1086	20004	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V210aefNormal01.png	...Your call.		1087		
1087	20004	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V210aefNormal01.png	Let's start the new challenge.				
1088	20005	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2110lnNormal06.png	Checkmate.		1089		
1089	20005	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V210aefNormal01.png	The chess piece is still moving according to the rules, but it requires more power to break it.		1090		
1090	20005	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2110lnNormal06.png	Guess we are close to the limit of the terminal's processing power.		1091		
1091	20005	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2110lnNormal06.png	Great. Let's see where its limit lies.

1094	4101	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	I was inspecting your battle gears as I planned to calibrate and upgrade some of their functions based on your recent combat patterns.		1095		
1095	4101	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	But I found that most of your equipment is in fact quite flawless, so I focused on the earbuds and came up with a few improvements.		1096

1098	4101	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	I also included some vocal data in the earbuds... Yeah, the one you wanted. So don't you lose them, because I don't want anyone to hear it except you.		1099		
1099	4101	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Your other gear is scheduled as well, so they'll start arriving in your armory in the upcoming days. Make sure you collect them then.		1100

1146	4107	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	In the past, I had set some sort of goals for my travels, such as looking for natural wonders and ancient architecture...		1147		
1147	4107	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	During the process, I discovered a few interesting places, and I made a map with their coordinates.		1148

1196	4113	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	I was trying to produce a perfume that suits you in the beginning.		1197		
1197	4113	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	But I found that I could never create what I envisioned during the process, regardless of the formula I used.		1198		
1198	4113	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	In hindsight, I've realized that no scent can match the impression you left me.		1199		
1199	4113	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	Unless... we give it meanings that it didn't have.		1200		
1200	4113	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	I figured I should just keep it simple. I hope it can bring you a moment of peace.		1201		
1201	4113	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	As for those ambiguities, let's leave them 'til we see each other. We'll talk about it then.

1221	4116	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Nanami has received the cookies you made! Hm? Let me guess—you're wondering how Nanami received them, aren't you?		1222		
1222	4116	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	That's a secret! Nanami's not going to tell you, Commandant!		1223

1224	4116	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	It's a little outdated, but Nanami collected all the parts and built it herself! I also handpicked all the cool photos of myself and glued them on, so—		1225		
1225	4116	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/Yongyechaonormal01.png	Little K is the one and only, exclusive communicative device between Nanami and Commandant! No matter where I am, I'll be able to contact you with Little K!		1226

1244	4119	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Commandant! Let me tell you something amazing!		1245		
1245	4119	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	I found a game that was very popular during the Golden Age when your cookies arrived, so I ate them while I was playing.		1246		
1246	4119	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Guess what? I easily beat all the previous records! Impressive, isn't it?		1247		
1247	4119	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	I thought about why for a long time, and I concluded that your cookies must have provided special buffs.		1248		
1248	4119	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Like an item in a video game!		1249		
1249	4119	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	That said, your cookies were so good that I finished them in one go. Now I don't feel like playing games anymore.		1250		
1250	4119	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Send me more cookies! Well, that was what I was going to ask you before I realized I should just come find you!		1251		
1251	4119	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	I bet I'd have a better time if I'm gaming with you, Commandant!		1252		
1252	4119	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	I even have the cartridges ready! I just need your answer!

1263	4121	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	Why are you looking so surprised? You sent me the cookies first. I'm just sending something back as is customary...		1264		
1264	4121	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	I'm not doing it for any reason other than that. I did spend a long time considering what to give you, though.		1265		
1265	4121	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	It's nothing special. Nixie tubes aren't anything new. They work in a similar way to neon lights.		1266		
1266	4121	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	Fill some vacuum tubes with different inert gases, and they will light up in different colors after being powered.		1267		
1267	4121	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	I found the design quite fascinating, so you... Ahem. It'd be nice if you like it too!		1268		
1268	4121	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	This isn't some prank or flattery. You haven't forgotten what today is, have you?		1269		
1269	4121	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	Anyway, that's what this is for... Nod if you get it! Jeez.

1318	4126	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	I found some cinnabar, orpiment, and lapis lazuli as raw material.		1319		
1319	4126	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	People used to extract colors from natural minerals and plants to make paints in the past.		1320		
1320	4126	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	You can then mix the primary colors to create any color, painting anything you want.		1321		
1321	4126	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	So, I've actually given you the colors of the whole world!		1322		
1322	4126	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	You haven't visited the WGAA for a while, Commandant. I'll be waiting for you here, so don't forget to come!				
1323	4127	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V200alNormal01.png	I've received the cookies you sent me, Commandant! Thank you!		1324		
1324	4127	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V200alNormal01.png	I've already finished all of them. I didn't waste one bit of your effort, Commandant!		1325		
1325	4127	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V200alNormal01.png	By the way, they tasted even better with chocolate sauce!		1326		
1326	4127	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V200alNormal01.png	You're quite a baker, Commandant.		1327		
1327	4127	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V200alNormal01.png	Let me give you some mineral paints I made myself in return.		1328		
1328	4127	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V200alNormal01.png	I found some cinnabar, orpiment, and lapis lazuli as raw material.		1329		
1329	4127	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V200alNormal01.png	People used to extract colors from natural minerals and plants to make paints in the past.		1330

1331	4127	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V200alNormal01.png	So, I've actually given you the colors of the whole world!		1332		
1332	4127	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V200alNormal01.png	You haven't visited the WGAA for a while, Commandant. I'll be waiting for you here, so don't forget to come!				
1333	4128	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	I received your handmade cookies, Commandant. They're tasty.		1334		
1334	4128	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	It's because of today's occasion, isn't it... I remember.		1335		
1335	4128	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	I've already sent you a gift in return. It's the same type of ledger I use daily.		1336		
1336	4128	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	Money can buy many things, but through our interactions, I've realized...		1337		
1337	4128	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	You can't put a price on a lot of things.		1338		
1338	4128	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	Still... money is great.		1339		
1339	4128	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	The things you buy belong to you, and it's nice to have something that belongs to you.		1340		
1340	4128	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	So you should record your gains and losses with a ledger.		1341		
1341	4128	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	I hope you get wealthier, Commandant.		1342		
1342	4128	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	I drew a puppy on the title page of the ledger. It's not very pretty, but you should be able to understand what it is.		1343		
1343	4128	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	...I look forward to seeing you next time.				
1344	4129	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	I'm happy to receive your gift, Commandant. I'll find time to enjoy this box of cookies properly.		1345		
1345	4129	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	As for my gift in return, I was notified ten minutes ago that you've also received it.		1346		
1346	4129	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	As you can see, it's a pop-up book. Once you open it, you'll find a three-dimensional ocean of knowledge.		1347		
1347	4129	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	It's a souvenir from the library in Zone K. I spent a long time there once, conversing with the books.		1348		
1348	4129	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	Nowadays, I no longer need to inquire about the silent ocean, because I have the Strike Hawk with me, and more importantly, I have you.		1349		
1349	4129	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	On this endless ocean, the lone boat has encountered a companion. The light will disperse the fog, revealing us to each other.		1350		
1350	4129	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	So, I want to thank you sincerely for being by my side, Commandant.		1351		
1351	4129	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	By the way, the library has been combined with a cafe. If you're free today, maybe you can join me there?		1352		
1352	4129	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	They're holding celebrations on the square as well. Our journey will be more exciting than we imagined, Commandant.				
1353	4130	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3kuluomuNormal02.png	I'm happy to receive your gift, Commandant. I'll find time to enjoy this box of cookies properly.		1354

1362	4131	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	I received the cookies you sent. Very characteristic of you to send me something so adorable.		1363		
1363	4131	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	Are you trying to win me over? You're getting greedy, Commandant, but I'm afraid it's going to be harder than you thought.		1364		
1364	4131	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	For example, there are some things I want more than these cookies. For example...		1365		
1365	4131	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	Your heart, and your time tonight. Yes, I want them very much.		1366		
1366	4131	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	To make today memorable, I've concocted this thoughtful drink.		1367		
1367	4131	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	Have you tried it yet? Did you taste the haunting sourness and sweetness? Do make sure that they haunt you, though.		1368		
1368	4131	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	Don't forget to finish every last sip of it. I added many nutrients that are good for you.		1369		
1369	4131	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	Find me if you enjoy it. I'm happy to refill it forever.				
1370	4132	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WeilaSNormal01.png	I received the cookies you sent. Very characteristic of you to send me something so adorable.		1371		
1371	4132	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WeilaSNormal01.png	Are you trying to win me over? You're getting greedy, Commandant, but I'm afraid it's going to be harder than you thought.		1372

1378	4133	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	Thank you for the cookies you sent, Commandant.		1379		
1379	4133	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	It reminded me of nights in the Arctic spent with a honey drink. My frame almost became more agile...		1380		
1380	4133	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	By the way, you've received my gift in return, haven't you?		1381		
1381	4133	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	That's right. It's the remake of the classic card game I mentioned last time.		1382		
1382	4133	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	But they've changed so much that the rules are completely unrecognizable. That's not a bad thing, though. We can learn the game together, Commandant.		1383		
1383	4133	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	When I was organizing the cards and wondering what kind of decks suit you, Commandant, I couldn't help but remember the time when we dueled.		1384		
1384	4133	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	Once we've gotten some practice in, let's join a tournament together!		1385		
1385	4133	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	...By the way, I ordered five booster boxes for both of us, but the manufacturer reduced their production out of nowhere, so only two arrived.		1386		
1386	4133	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	My box was a dud, but... that means yours must have some great cards in it.		1387		
1387	4133	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	You're going to pull a legendary next. I know it!				
1388	4134	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	Yo! I got your cookies!		1389		
1389	4134	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	I'm going to find a chance to hide in my secret base and enjoy it all by myself.		1390		
1390	4134	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	I hope my gift has also arrived in your hands in one piece.		1391		
1391	4134	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	This little thing took me quite a lot of effort to acquire, but you're worth it.		1392		
1392	4134	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	Think about it—the next time you have annoying documents or folders or whatever delivered to your table...		1393		
1393	4134	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	Bam! Down goes the qilin to keep them all in place. Isn't that sweet?		1394		
1394	4134	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	Maybe you'll have more free time then, the next time we see each other.		1395		
1395	4134	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	I'll get to take you to unwind.		1396		
1396	4134	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	There are so many interesting things in Kowloong. I've prepared them all for you.		1397		
1397	4134	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	I'll see you soon!				
1398	4135	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	"The cookies are surprisingly tasty. All I can say is that you're certainly the ""all-capable"" commandant if you're even good at baking."		1399		
1399	4135	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	All-capable, hah. That was how the people in the last conservation area I was near described you.		1400		
1400	4135	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	After I regained my freedom and set foot on this land again, I've found that the world has changed a lot indeed.		1401		
1401	4135	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	For example, your name is everywhere since who-knows-when.		1402		
1402	4135	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	Your deeds can be found on the radio, on notice boards, in conversations, or on a random newspaper being blown away in the wind.		1403		
1403	4135	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	But the details... Hmph. Defending against the Corrupted army single-handedly, breaking through the Hetero-Creatures' siege by yourself, scaring off an attacking Ascendant with a mere look...		1404		
1404	4135	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	You should have received the doll I made you based on these tall tales. What do you think? Does it look like you?		1405		
1405	4135	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	That said... I'm surprised to find the confluence of expectations and the vessel of hope on you too.		1406		
1406	4135	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	Perhaps you'll encounter the problems I encountered one day.		1407		
1407	4135	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	When that happens, will you be beholden to the people's expectations, steer their course, or forge a new path...?		1408		
1408	4135	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	I'll accompany you until the end, and perhaps we'll find out together.

1421	4136	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	I saw them right as I got up to leave. As to how I figured out it was you...		1422		
1422	4136	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	Would you believe me if I said I saw it in my dream?		1423		
1423	4136	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	They taste great. It was perfect as the first meal after a full night's sleep.		1424		
1424	4136	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	For my gift in return... How about this?		1425		
1425	4136	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	"A bottle of ""emergency mood boosters"" exclusive from me. I guarantee that all your problems will be solved after you take one."		1426		
1426	4136	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	I'm not treating you like a child. It's a scientific fact that sugar makes you happy.		1427		
1427	4136	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	When I'm not by your side, take a booster and cheer up.		1428		
1428	4136	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	And when I'm by your side...		1429		
1429	4136	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	"This doctor is going to do all he can to ""cure"" his patient."				
1430	4137	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/21haoNormal01.png	They told me that people are supposed to exchange... erm, exchange something on this day.		1431		
1431	4137	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/21haoNormal01.png	But I haven't gone on any mission recently, so I don't have any trophies to exchange. So I figured I'd give you the hair I brushed out from my tail, Commandant.		1432		
1432	4137	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/21haoNormal01.png	Since I don't spend much time with you every time we're together, the scent I leave behind never lasts. It's like something I own is sneaking away slowly and secretly.		1433		
1433	4137	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/21haoNormal01.png	If it's gone, I won't be able to find you, and I don't like this empty feeling. So I'm giving you my tail hair. It has my scent on it.		1434		
1434	4137	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/21haoNormal01.png	Now, no matter where you are and what you look like, I will always recognize you!		1435

1440	4138	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V23021Normal01.png	Now, no matter where you are and what you look like, I will always recognize you!		1441		
1441	4138	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V23021Normal01.png	Keep it safe.				
1442	4139	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	I got your cookies. I gave them a proper taste.		1443		
1443	4139	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	They tasted surprisingly great, I must say.		1444		
1444	4139	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Hmph. You must be after something if you spent so much effort making the cookies.		1445		
1445	4139	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Ahem... In return, I've sculpted a wooden wolf for you.		1446		
1446	4139	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Wolves are prideful animals. Once they identify their pack, they will protect each other at any cost.		1447		
1447	4139	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	...Don't overthink it. I only meant to say that I empathize with their survival instincts.		1448		
1448	4139	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	If I consider someone as part of my pack, I'll also protect them at any cost until the end.		1449		
1449	4139	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	...		1450		
1450	4139	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Just go ahead and accept my protection. You can leave the rest to me.				
1451	4140	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	I received your gift a while ago, and I really enjoyed those cookies. They tasted good, and they looked pleasant.		1452		
1452	4140	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	I was going to send you some Kowloong specialties, but I was too busy to find the chance to do it, unfortunately.		1453		
1453	4140	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	I was surprised to find you sending me something first. It seems that you have not forgotten your role as my partner.		1454		
1454	4140	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	To thank you and gift you something in return on this special occasion, I must treat it seriously.		1455		
1455	4140	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	At first, I picked a selection of gift boxes, but you didn't register as someone frivolous with shallow interests to me.		1456		
1456	4140	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	After some thought, I got my men to procure some fine materials to create a bookmark with the painting I did a few days ago on it.		1457		
1457	4140	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	I hope you get to see it every time you flip through a book, and I hope you'll think of me when you see it.		1458		
1458	4140	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	It's good to read more. Keep me in your thoughts.				
1459	4156	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V290qNormal01.png	I received your gift a while ago, and I really enjoyed those cookies. They tasted good, and they looked pleasant.		1460

1467	4141	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	It's a bit of a shame that I couldn't give you this letter and this present sooner.		1468		
1468	4141	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	I hesitated for too long. I didn't know what I could prepare that could represent my feelings.		1469		
1469	4141	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	Although songs can carry ideas, it must feel a little repetitive that we keep exchanging music.		1470		
1470	4141	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	Luckily, there's someone who knows me more than I do.		1471		
1471	4141	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	Conductor, I was walking in a valley when I received your cookies, and I got to enjoy a whole day of flowers and sunshine with them.		1472		
1472	4141	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	The cookies were lovely. The tenderness I tasted was not unlike the beautiful blossoms in the wild.		1473		
1473	4141	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	That was when I realized what to give you.		1474		
1474	4141	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	I have placed the seasons neatly in a box. I hope you'll like it, Conductor.		1475		
1475	4141	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	A star fell from the heavens into the mortal haze. I brought to spring my blossoming days.				
1476	4142	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal07.png	It's a bit of a shame that I couldn't give you this letter and this present sooner.		1477

1485	4143	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	"Surprise! Did you receive my ""surprise"", Gray Raven Commandant?"		1486		
1486	4143	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	I picked it just for you. It's only polite to offer a gift in return, and I wouldn't dare to forget my manners.		1487		
1487	4143	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	As for the gift you sent—I haven't tasted food like cookies for a long time, but I'll treasure them.		1488		
1488	4143	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	I wonder if a Babylonia Chief like you noticed the intricacies of my surprise.		1489		
1489	4143	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	You must have thought it an ordinary mirror at first, but you'll discover its more mysterious qualities after a close inspection.		1490		
1490	4143	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	The midsummer night's dream—a rowdy farce, and a display of humanity's instincts—		1491		
1491	4143	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	The world in the mirror encompasses an endless field of flowers.		1492		
1492	4143	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	"""If you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you."""		1493		
1493	4143	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	As for the words it hides in its depth...		1494		
1494	4143	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	You mustn't explain a masterpiece. It will speak for itself.				
1495	4144	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal04.png	I got your cookies! Thank you, Commandant!		1496		
1496	4144	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal04.png	This is my gift for you—my scrapbook!		1497		
1497	4144	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal04.png	When I received the photos we took together, I couldn't help but feel that they were missing some decorations...		1498		
1498	4144	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal04.png	I put a sticker next to it, and it still felt lacking.		1499		
1499	4144	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal04.png	So I found a lot more stickers until I came across a super adorable panda!		1500		
1500	4144	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal04.png	But it didn't feel right to replace all the other stickers with one panda...		1501		
1501	4144	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal04.png	So I got a notebook to put all of them in!		1502		
1502	4144	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal04.png	I heard that there should be more photos in a scrapbook...		1503		
1503	4144	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal04.png	But we're going to take a lot more photos when we're together, aren't we?		1504		
1504	4144	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal04.png	Yeah! One day, every sticker in this scrapbook will find a photo to decorate!				
1505	4145	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	Thank you for the cookies you sent. I've inspected the interior of the box, and I can confirm that they are excellent baked goods.		1506		
1506	4145	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	After carefully reading through the encyclopedia on your festivals in the database, I've come to understand the reason why you sent me a gift on this day.		1507		
1507	4145	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	I also understand that I need to offer you something of equal value in return.		1508		
1508	4145	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	From my observations, you're prone to working overnight and sleeping late. I can imagine the air quality in your room affects your health greatly.		1509		
1509	4145	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	My calculation suggests that spending a prolonged period of time in an unventilated room makes you more tired and less effective.		1510		
1510	4145	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	I ordered this air purifier from a nearby research center. I hope it will improve the air quality of your workspace.		1511		
1511	4145	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	Don't worry. I specifically requested the manufacturer to lower its volume while it's running so that it wouldn't interrupt your rest.		1512		
1512	4145	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	If you have further questions, feel free to contact me through your terminal.		1513		
1513	4145	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	Have a nice day.				
1514	4146	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NuoanNormal01.png	Long time no see, Commandant, and thanks for the cookies. I was wondering what you were up to when I heard you borrowed the kitchen of the patisserie.		1515		
1515	4146	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NuoanNormal01.png	Do you want to teach me how to bake cookies later? I would love to give you a hand if you wish.		1516		
1516	4146	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NuoanNormal01.png	It's not for any particular reason. I just want to spend more time with you after being apart for so long.		1517		
1517	4146	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NuoanNormal01.png	I was planning to bring you a gift before you went to the patisserie.		1518		
1518	4146	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NuoanNormal01.png	Yeah, I miss you... Can't I?				
1519	4147	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	Commandant, Bambinata has received the cookies you sent.		1520		
1520	4147	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	Having received such a nice gift, Bambinata is... really happy.		1521		
1521	4147	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	Bambinata's memory data shows that today is a special day.		1522		
1522	4147	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	If this is how you express your feelings, Commandant, then Bambinata should... prepare something for you in return.		1523		
1523	4147	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	Bambinata noticed the commandant wearing a sparkling brooch in the past, so...		1524		
1524	4147	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	Bambinata took some time to collect a lot of brooches and picked a few that seemed to fit the commandant.		1525		
1525	4147	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	But Bambinata isn't sure if the commandant would like the ones Bambinata picked.		1526		
1526	4147	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	If you don't mind, will you wear them next time, Commandant?				
1527	4148	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V220hyNormal01.png	Greetings, Commandant. I received your gift a while ago, and it's been bringing me a lot of joy.		1528		
1528	4148	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V220hyNormal01.png	Much has been said about the connection between people and things. When I saw the cookies, I was reminded of your face, Commandant.		1529		
1529	4148	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V220hyNormal01.png	I hope I'm not being presumptuous, but I would like to enjoy these treats with you in person.		1530		
1530	4148	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V220hyNormal01.png	Will you make my wish come true...?		1531		
1531	4148	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V220hyNormal01.png	In return, I asked Pulao to collect some calming herbal medicine, and I placed the powder in a sachet I made myself.		1532		
1532	4148	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V220hyNormal01.png	I know you must be tired from all the frequent traveling you do. Please take care of yourself.		1533		
1533	4148	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V220hyNormal01.png	I hope this sachet can take my place by your bed and accompany you in your sleep...		1534		
1534	4148	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V220hyNormal01.png	Perhaps we'll meet in your dreams.				
1535	4157	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2130hyNormal01.png	Greetings, Commandant. I received your gift a while ago, and it's been bringing me a lot of joy.		1536		
1536	4157	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2130hyNormal01.png	Much has been said about the connection between people and things. When I saw the cookies, I was reminded of your face, Commandant.		1537		
1537	4157	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2130hyNormal01.png	I hope I'm not being presumptuous, but I would like to enjoy these treats with you in person.		1538		
1538	4157	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2130hyNormal01.png	Will you make my wish come true...?		1539		
1539	4157	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2130hyNormal01.png	In return, I asked Pulao to collect some calming herbal medicine, and I placed the powder in a sachet I made myself.		1540		
1540	4157	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2130hyNormal01.png	I know you must be tired from all the frequent traveling you do. Please take care of yourself.		1541		
1541	4157	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2130hyNormal01.png	I hope this sachet can take my place by your bed and accompany you in your sleep...		1542		
1542	4157	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2130hyNormal01.png	Perhaps we'll meet in your dreams.				
1543	4149	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	Hey, partner, I got your cookies! They taste awesome! Best cookies I've had, seriously.		1544		
1544	4149	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	Since you made my gift yourself, I gotta put effort into making yours.		1545		
1545	4149	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	Relax! I did my homework this time. I know what to give on a day like this!		1546		
1546	4149	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	You won't find your gift hidden inside a confetti bomb that spatters all over you this time.		1547		
1547	4149	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	So? Aren't you touched when you open the gift I prepared?		1548		
1548	4149	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	Hmph! It doesn't end there. From now on, I'll be delivering you more and more surprises!		1549		
1549	4149	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	Not just today—I'm going to make sure that you're surrounded by surprises every single day!		1550		
1550	4149	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	Sit tight and enjoy my show!				
1551	4150	1	Echo	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V250ylsNormal01.png	Thank you for your gift, Commandant.		1552		
1552	4150	1	Echo	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V250ylsNormal01.png	I ought to send you a gift in return as soon as possible, but I couldn't decide what to give you until now. I apologize.		1553		
1553	4150	1	Echo	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V250ylsNormal01.png	I really wanted to show you how thankful I am for your care, so I struggled to come up with something for a long time.		1554		
1554	4150	1	Echo	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V250ylsNormal01.png	Luckily, my sister reminded me that it's the thought that counts, no matter what the gift is.		1555		
1555	4150	1	Echo	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V250ylsNormal01.png	Fortunately, I came across this immediately in the new accessories shop on the shopping street.		1556		
1556	4150	1	Echo	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V250ylsNormal01.png	It was warm and bright like a fire, and pure and free like wings. It instantly reminded me of you, Commandant.		1557		
1557	4150	1	Echo	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V250ylsNormal01.png	It can decorate, it can be admired, and it can... well... express how I feel.		1558		
1558	4150	1	Echo	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V250ylsNormal01.png	I really hope you'll like this gift, Commandant.		1559		
1559	4150	1	Echo	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V250ylsNormal01.png	I wish you all the best.				
1560	4151	1	Lamia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V260lmyNormal01.png	Thank you for the little cookies you sent me. I... I thought you wanted me to deliver them to someone else for you...		1561		
1561	4151	1	Lamia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V260lmyNormal01.png	They taste great. I don't want to finish them in one go, so there are still many left. I'm only having a little bit every day... Hopefully, they'll last until the next time we meet.		1562		
1562	4151	1	Lamia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V260lmyNormal01.png	You've sent me something so precious, and I don't know what to give you in return.		1563		
1563	4151	1	Lamia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V260lmyNormal01.png	Many people offered suggestions, but if I followed them, the gift wouldn't be from me anymore, would it?		1564		
1564	4151	1	Lamia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V260lmyNormal01.png	That won't do. For once, you're accepting a gift from an Ascendant...		1565		
1565	4151	1	Lamia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V260lmyNormal01.png	But what do you need? You seem to have everything I can offer...		1566		
1566	4151	1	Lamia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V260lmyNormal01.png	I spent a long time sitting on a rock and thinking. Staring at the ocean, I remembered something I used to read about.		1567		
1567	4151	1	Lamia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V260lmyNormal01.png	It said that everyone was submerged in water before they were born. Some people even prepared a special tank of salt water just to fully relax.		1568		
1568	4151	1	Lamia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V260lmyNormal01.png	The gentle water must be relaxing, right? So, I made you a liquid hourglass in the color of the sea.		1569		
1569	4151	1	Lamia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V260lmyNormal01.png	When you're tired, flip it over. You can rest until it stops.		1570		
1570	4151	1	Lamia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V260lmyNormal01.png	One more thing... D-don't throw it away if you don't like it. Just let me know. I'll think of something else to give you.				
1571	4152	1	Teddy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2100boxNormal01.png	The terminal just reminded me about today when your cookies arrived.		1572		
1572	4152	1	Teddy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2100boxNormal01.png	You've got good taste, Commandant. How did you find out that I like this flavor?		1573		
1573	4152	1	Teddy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2100boxNormal01.png	It's a treat worthy of a nice cup of tea.		1574		
1574	4152	1	Teddy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2100boxNormal01.png	That's perfect, then. The tea set I sent you is for this exact purpose. You should have received it by now.		1575		
1575	4152	1	Teddy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2100boxNormal01.png	Hmm... The box looks half empty? Obviously. These types of customized teacups often come in pairs.		1576		
1576	4152	1	Teddy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2100boxNormal01.png	Where's the other cup?		1577		
1577	4152	1	Teddy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2100boxNormal01.png	Bring yours and find me, and I'll tell you.				
1578	4153	1	Bridget	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2120bljtNormal01.png	I received your handmade cookies. I didn't know you're this good at baking.		1579		
1579	4153	1	Bridget	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2120bljtNormal01.png	I've sent you a lantern as well, but it's kind of an antique. You need to refuel it manually to keep it lit up.		1580		
1580	4153	1	Bridget	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2120bljtNormal01.png	Sometimes, you just need to force yourself to use something less convenient to make sure you don't get rusty, you know?		1581		
1581	4153	1	Bridget	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2120bljtNormal01.png	It's inevitable to strive for efficiency, but I sometimes prefer the more archaic way of doing things. It's fun in its own way.		1582		
1582	4153	1	Bridget	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2120bljtNormal01.png	Like the cookies you sent me. They're unique and memorable because you made them yourself.		1583		
1583	4153	1	Bridget	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2120bljtNormal01.png	So... How about a drink on this memorable night?		1584		
1584	4153	1	Bridget	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2120bljtNormal01.png	I can teach you how to use the lantern myself.		1585		
1585	4153	1	Bridget	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2120bljtNormal01.png	I have confidence in my work. This lamp won't break even if you smash it on a rock.		1586		
1586	4153	1	Bridget	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2120bljtNormal01.png	It's a date, then. I'll see you at our spot.				
1587	5101	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Commandant, your postcard arrived. Looking back on this journey, I've come to realize how truly soothing the blue ocean can be for the mind.		1588		
1588	5101	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	If possible, let's stay here a bit longer.		1589		
1589	5101	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Actually, I have a gift for you too. Maybe it's all the ocean memories from this trip... they reminded me of that time we went snorkeling together. So these past few days, I've been trying to find a really special underwater view.		1590		
1590	5101	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	I found this island—coral reefs, schools of tropical fish, and even a shipwreck... The sights here are way more spectacular than where we went last time.		1591		
1591	5101	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	If you ever want to go diving again, this island would be a great spot.		1592		
1592	5101	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	And just so you know, if you need a guide who knows the area, I'd be happy to help.		1593		
1593	5101	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LiangNomal01.png	Don't worry about anything going wrong this time. I'll be right by your side every step of the way.				
1594	5102	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LiangNormal01.png	Commandant, your postcard arrived. Looking back on this journey, I've come to realize how truly soothing the blue ocean can be for the mind.		1595

1608	5104	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	I received your postcard, Commandant.		1609		
1609	5104	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	So that's why you've been documenting every moment of this trip... It was all for this special gift.		1610		
1610	5104	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	This will forever bring back the memories of all these days we've spent together.		1611		
1611	5104	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	I see all the thought you put into this. Thank you, Commandant. This is the most precious treasure of this journey.		1612		
1612	5104	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Before we set off, I picked up some seaweed ropes at a portside shop.		1613		
1613	5104	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	I braided them into two four-leaf clover bracelets and was just about to give you one. It'd make the perfect reply to your postcard.		1614		
1614	5104	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Let's take a picture of us wearing these bracelets together. Since we've captured so many wonderful moments along the way, I want to leave this final mark with you at our journey's end.		1615		
1615	5104	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Are you in the lounge right now? Hold on, I'll be right there.

1640	5107	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	Your postcard is packed with memories. Looks like you really enjoyed this journey.		1641		
1641	5107	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	The ocean views are breathtaking, if only there weren't always hordes of tourists crowding the deck. It gets pretty chaotic out there.		1642		
1642	5107	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	Tried tolerating it a few times, but I just can't get used to crowds. Might as well steer clear of them.		1643		
1643	5107	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	I found a jet ski in the yacht's storage. I'm thinking of taking it out for a spin.		1644		
1644	5107	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	You want to join me? This jet ski is designed for two.		1645		
1645	5107	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	Don't worry about falling off—I've got you anti-slip gloves. And if that's not enough...		1646		
1646	5107	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3LuxiyaNormal03.png	Just hold on tight to me.

1655	5109	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Thank you too, Commandant, for taking so many photos for me along the trip. Flipping through the album later will surely bring back wonderful memories.		1656		
1656	5109	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	When we docked to rest, I found an unripe coconut fallen under a palm tree.		1657		
1657	5109	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	It seemed a waste to leave it buried in the sand, so I picked it up and made it into a toy.		1658		
1658	5109	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	"They call these coconut shell toys ""Coco"", I think?"		1659

1685	5112	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal04.png	So tonight, sleep well and dream sweetly, Commandant.				
1686	5113	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	Commandant, do you hear something different?		1687		
1687	5113	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	I received your postcard and wanted to thank you in person.		1688		
1688	5113	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	Then I saw you still asleep, so I hung this salt mist wind chime by your window instead.		1689		
1689	5113	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	I sat beside you for a long while and thought about recording your sleep murmurs.		1690		
1690	5113	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	But in the end, I decided it ws enough just for me to hear them.		1691		
1691	5113	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	They say the sound of the salt mist chime helps lock memories deeper into the listener's heart.		1692		
1692	5113	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/OlisuoNomal01.png	So, Commandant... have these shared moments of our journey been engraved in yours?

1743	5119	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	I got your postcard! I knew you'd have a surprise for me. I could just tell!		1744		
1744	5119	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	During the trip, I noticed you eyeing souvenirs, so I totally saw this coming. Pretty sharp, right?		1745		
1745	5119	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Of course, I didn't come empty-handed either. Your gift should arrive soon.		1746		
1746	5119	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	It's something I spent ages picking out! It's a speaker designed to look like the ocean's surface, even with ripple projections.		1747		
1747	5119	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	I hope it'll bring back memories of all the views we shared.		1748		
1748	5119	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Oh, and there's more! The speaker has a hidden compartment for aromatherapy. I picked a scent that smells just like the sea to me. Let me know what you think!		1749		
1749	5119	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Between the rippling light and that refreshing fragrance... it's like we're right back there together.		1750		
1750	5119	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Your postcard does the same thing! Our gifts are like two keys unlocking the same treasure chest of memories.		1751		
1751	5119	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	With them, we can now relive the beautiful moments we shared together, anytime we want!		1752		
1752	5119	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShenweiNormal01.png	Oh, the speaker's sound quality is great. I've pre-loaded it with that song we listened during the trip. Just hit play.

1763	5121	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	Ugh, the ship's security checks were such a hassle! Went through endless loops just to finally get your postcard.		1764		
1764	5121	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	Ahem! Not that I didn't want it or anything! Just saying their security is way too strict!		1765		
1765	5121	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	And you... why went through all the trouble? We're literally on the same ship, but you had to mail it with some... some weird postmark...		1766		
1766	5121	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	"So roundabout! Fine, I'll show you how it's done properly: ""I have a gift for you because it's that day today, so... p-please take it..."""		1767		
1767	5121	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	Don't give me that look! I'm just demonstrating! Pay attention and learn properly!		1768		
1768	5121	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	Anyway, the ship hosted a craft workshop lately, where you could build model ships with provided materials. Seemed fun, so I casually made a few as souvenirs for everyone back home.		1769		
1769	5121	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	Yes, that means you're not the only one getting it! I made them for everyone! Yours just... happened to be too big for my luggage, so I had to give it to you today.		1770		
1770	5121	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	And why is yours way larger than the others? Don't read into it! You were last on the list, and there were leftover materials. Wasting them would've been bad, so I used them all!		1771		
1771	5121	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/KalieninaNomal01.png	J-just take it and stop asking questions!

1790	5124	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	Thank you for organizing this trip... I had a wonderful time.		1791		
1791	5124	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	And thank you for reminding me that life sometimes needs moments like these—to pause, breathe, and gather strength for whatever comes next.		1792		
1792	5124	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	By the way, do you know why the beach we saw is white, Commandant?		1793		
1793	5124	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	"They call this sand ""white sand"" because it's made from countless seashells, washed ashore and broken down by the waves until all that's left is this pale, powdery softness."		1794		
1794	5124	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	As a keepsake, I brought back a bottle of white sand from the shore we stayed at.		1795		
1795	5124	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	I made this bottle into a mini seascape, so you can keep that beach with you always, like a tiny sea.		1796		
1796	5124	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/DubianNormal01.png	Even years later... the white sand and seawater in the bottle would still look just like that summer day.		1797

1803	5125	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3DubianNormal01.png	I made this bottle into a mini seascape, so you can keep that beach with you always, like a tiny sea.		1804		
1804	5125	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3DubianNormal01.png	Even years later... the white sand and seawater in the bottle would still look just like that summer day.		1805		
1805	5125	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3DubianNormal01.png	Commandant, I won't forget this summer with you, either.				
1806	5154	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V280dbNormal01.png	Thank you for organizing this trip... I had a wonderful time.		1807		
1807	5154	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V280dbNormal01.png	And thank you for reminding me that life sometimes needs moments like these—to pause, breathe, and gather strength for whatever comes next.		1808		
1808	5154	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V280dbNormal01.png	By the way, do you know why the beach we saw is white, Commandant?		1809

1814	5126	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	We took so many photos during our trip. All of them are perfect art references!		1815		
1815	5126	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	These precious memories? I'm absolutely going to pour them ALL onto my canvas!		1816		
1816	5126	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	Commandant, the postcard you gave me brought those moments back to life.		1817		
1817	5126	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	But of course, I've got my own favorite sight to share with you too!		1818		
1818	5126	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	These acrylic paintings have depicted the trails of whale migration.		1819		
1819	5126	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	They say right whales can sing love songs with the widest vocal ranges, gentle as moonlit waves.		1820		
1820	5126	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	Now, I know sound can't really be captured in a painting...		1821		
1821	5126	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AilaNormal01.png	But I just know you'll feel the same magic anyway!

1830	5128	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	It was truly wonderful to see the ocean again.		1831		
1831	5128	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	Back on the train, glimpses of the sea were rare.		1832		
1832	5128	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	This journey will remain a cherished memory.		1833		
1833	5128	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	And yes, Commandant, your postcard arrived.		1834		
1834	5128	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	"I spent a long time deciding how to reciprocate, but in the end, I kept coming back to one truth: ""memory"" is the most precious gift of all."		1835		
1835	5128	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	I once read that familiar scents can summon the past in vivid detail.		1836		
1836	5128	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	So I thought... why not capture the essence of our trip in a fragrance?		1837		
1837	5128	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	The scent of the ocean... was harder to recreate than expected.		1838		
1838	5128	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	It took countless attempts to get it just right.		1839		
1839	5128	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	But now, whenever you catch this aroma, may it carry you back to our shared days.				
1840	5129	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	Hey Commandant, you done napping?		1841		
1841	5129	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	At last night's candlelit dinner on the beach with you, we talked for so long that by the time we said goodnight, it was well past midnight.		1842		
1842	5129	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	Sharing our thoughts under the candlelight... that warmth is something I'll never forget.		1843		
1843	5129	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	I wished time would slow down just a little longer, just to stay with you a bit more.		1844		
1844	5129	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	That's why I bought the wine glasses we used as a keepsake of this trip.		1845		
1845	5129	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	Tomorrow, the cruise will dock, yet it still feels like our time together was far too short.		1846		
1846	5129	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	But I know this for certain: our next journey will be even more beautiful.		1847		
1847	5129	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	There are still so many memories waiting for us to shape together.

1856	5131	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	Oh? Thought you'd grown some wings and started ignoring my calls.		1857		
1857	5131	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	I found a lighter, weirdly identical to my old one. What are the odds?		1858		
1858	5131	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	Since you've been almost tolerable on this cruise, I'll let you have it.		1859

1877	5133	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	The blizzard that had persisted for so long finally subsided today.		1878		
1878	5133	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	It felt like a good omen, as if something wonderful was about to happen. And just as I thought so, Commandant, your postcard arrived.		1879		
1879	5133	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	To my delight, your next stop, as marked on the postcard, isn't far from where I am.		1880		
1880	5133	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	Some time ago, New Sophiasburgh held a fortune-drawing event to wish departing sailors good luck.		1881		
1881	5133	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	"Though called a ""divination,"" every slip in the tube was a ""best fortune""—really, it was just a way for everyone to send their blessings to each crew member."		1882		
1882	5133	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	"""Your wishes shall be granted by heaven."" That was the slip I drew. And now, it seems it has proven unexpectedly prophetic."		1883		
1883	5133	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	"Perhaps it was borrowing some of your luck, but regardless, I want to pass this blessing on to you. Before setting off, I even made a few extra ""best fortunes"" slips."		1884		
1884	5133	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	By the time you read this, I'll likely already be nearing your side.		1885		
1885	5133	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	Let me deliver these slips—along with the original one—into your hands myself. With such fortune on our side, I'm certain today will be a beautiful and unforgettable day spent with you, Commandant.				
1886	5134	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	Ah, when traveling with you, even the familiar sea breeze feels precious now.		1887		
1887	5134	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	A letter to home always carries endless thoughts. How considerate of you. This special postcard you sent will be treasured.		1888		
1888	5134	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	Speaking of which, I've got plenty of amusing travel stories to share with you too!		1889		
1889	5134	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	But it's not just stories I want to tell you...		1890		
1890	5134	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	"You know how I love collecting little curiosities? Well, these antique coins—elegant, lightweight, and exquisitely crafted—one marked ""Five,"" the other ""Twenty."""		1891		
1891	5134	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	It took me ages to track down a matching pair, just to save them for today as a surprise.		1892		
1892	5134	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ChangyuNormal03.png	All I ask is that when you carry them, you might think of me once or twice. Consider them your VIP teahouse tickets!		1893

1897	5135	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	Now, I think I'm beginning to grasp its meaning.		1898		
1898	5135	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	Today is a special holiday, and I recorded the moon's phase and crafted this little keepsake.		1899		
1899	5135	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	No matter how the world changes, the moon remains constant in the heavens.		1900		
1900	5135	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LunaNormal03.png	Just as, from now on, it will forever hold your shape in my eyes.

1908	5136	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	Your gift-giving methods are becoming... unconventional, to say the least.		1909		
1909	5136	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WanshiNormal01.png	I found it under my pillow, though I must admit, I accidentally crumpled it in my sleep. The words were a bit hard to make out after that.		1910

1929	5137	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/21haoNormal01.png	There are many humans on the metal whale. They try to stop me. But they are weak. I knock them down, no claws needed.		1930		
1930	5137	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/21haoNormal01.png	You say humans surrender fast? This is the food they give us?		1931		
1931	5137	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/21haoNormal01.png	Tastes salty. This is our prize now. You can eat too.		1932		
1932	5137	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/21haoNormal01.png	Because it's a holiday, I share everything with you, Commandant. Half for you, half for me!		1933		
1933	5137	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/21haoNormal01.png	Today, you are pack leader. Where we go next? I can hunt more prizes for you! Bigger! Stronger!				
1934	5138	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V23021Normal01.png	I found a mechanical whale that runs on water!		1935

1942	5139	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	I've got your postcard. Knew you'd pull something like this.		1943		
1943	5139	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	When we wrote wishes on that wall, you asked what I wrote. Bet you were already scheming back then.		1944		
1944	5139	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	I'm not an idiot. Your face says everything.		1945		
1945	5139	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	The rule about that wishing wall was clear: after leaving a wish, you carry a substitute to make it come true. I didn't forget.		1946		
1946	5139	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Guess your postcard's the substitute, huh?		1947		
1947	5139	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Since you made mine, I handled yours. It should've arrived by now.		1948		
1948	5139	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Remember you asked what I was scavenging for on the beach? Sea glass. Turns out, legends say they carry blessings too.		1949		
1949	5139	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	One piece equals one blessing, and I've got you seven of them. Should be enough.		1950		
1950	5139	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	I heard the last blessing needs to be spoken out loud to the other person. Well... fine, I'll be your victim.		1951		
1951	5139	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	But today only. I'll be waiting.				
1952	5140	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	I've read your postcard. Your joy practically leaps off the page. I'm glad this journey has been everything you hoped for.		1953		
1953	5140	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	You know, I've visited this ancient waterside town many times before. But when I wandered alone in the past, my eyes were always drawn to the intricate architecture or the mountain streams—the obvious beauty.		1954		
1954	5140	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	Now, with you here beside me, even the things I once overlooked seem worth pausing for.		1955		
1955	5140	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	Take that little trinket shop we passed earlier, for instance. The old me would've never imagined stepping inside, agonizing over the perfect gift for someone else.		1956		
1956	5140	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	I ended up choosing a love lock, one I engraved with both our names. They say if you fasten it to a place of fate, the gods will bless those named upon it, binding their hearts together for life.		1957		
1957	5140	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	I've never put much stock in such fleeting legends, but if it's just a way to ask for a blessing—for us—well, there's no harm in that, is there?		1958		
1958	5140	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/QuNormal02.png	So... care to join me in looking for that place of fate?				
1959	5156	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V290qNormal01.png	I've read your postcard. Your joy practically leaps off the page. I'm glad this journey has been everything you hoped for.		1960

1966	5141	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	Conductor, I tried to capture the voice of the sea—this nocturnal symphony was meant as a gift for you.		1967		
1967	5141	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	But by the next morningt, I realized that such a small glass bottle could never hold an entire shore.		1968		
1968	5141	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	So once again, I tried to capture that moment, in my own way.		1969		
1969	5141	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	Conductor, please place this postcard before you, close your eyes, and let your imagination come alive.		1970		
1970	5141	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	Amid the rhythmic sighs of cerulean waves, as the tides ebb and flow, a whale's distant song drifts through the air...		1971		
1971	5141	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	And there we stand together, you and I, beholding this scene side by side.		1972		
1972	5141	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	As the morning light rises, the waves fade, and the sea regains its crystal clarity...		1973		
1973	5141	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	Here we remain, leaning against each other as we have done through countless sunrises and sunsets, greeting another new day in the radiant dawn light.		1974		
1974	5141	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal05.png	...Conductor, have my feelings reached your heart?				
1975	5142	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal07.png	Conductor, I tried to capture the voice of the sea—this nocturnal symphony was meant as a gift for you.		1976

1993	5143	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	I've got your postcard, Gray Raven Commandant.		1994		
1994	5143	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	No need to explain—even without a signature, I'd know it was from you.		1995		
1995	5143	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	"If you insist on playing coy... let's just say I ""claimed"" it as my prize. The label doesn't matter, as long as it was once yours."		1996		
1996	5143	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	Now, it's my turn to return the favor.		1997		
1997	5143	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	When you see it, you might feel a sense of familiarity. We have both chosen the same kind of memory, after all.		1998		
1998	5143	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	You preserved those views in the postcard, while I processed the petals taken from the same shores.		1999		
1999	5143	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	"Either way, those memories have achieved a form of ""immortality."""		2000		
2000	5143	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	"Even with all the complications due to our stances... we have always shared this quiet understanding—call it ""companionship,"" if you will."		2001		
2001	5143	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	Let those memories stay suspended in time, just like... this resin-sealed bloom.				
2002	5144	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal04.png	Commandant, your postcard looks like you've been having SO much fun on your trip!		2003		
2003	5144	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal04.png	I really wanted to join you, but duty got in the way...		2004		
2004	5144	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal04.png	Good news though—mission's done, and we're finally meeting today!		2005		
2005	5144	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal04.png	I've saved up a ton of interesting stories for you these days, and I can't help but wonder what expression you'll make when you hear them.		2006		
2006	5144	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal04.png	I even made these shell carvings. Every single one's got a story I can't wait to tell you!		2007		
2007	5144	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal04.png	...Okay fine, some carvings are kinda wobbly because I got overexcited...		2008		
2008	5144	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal04.png	But that's no problem! When we meet today, I can just tell you those messy parts in person!		2009		
2009	5144	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/PulaoNormal04.png	So, get ready for our story exchange!				
2010	5145	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	"Thank you for the postcard. So this is what humans call a ""travel souvenir."" From the heart-shaped postmark, I have sensed a higher sentimental value that this holds than ordinary items."		2011		
2011	5145	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	I have created a full 3D model of it in my database, with 24/7 display priority in my visual feed.		2012		
2012	5145	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	After scanning the onboard objects, I also selected something for you—a pseudo-Golden Age calculation device.		2013		
2013	5145	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	Analysis confirms its vintage traits align with my simulation of your preferences.		2014		
2014	5145	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	While my processing capacity exceeds this unit by 387.73333%, my calculations suggest its value to you transcends technical specifications.		2015		
2015	5145	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	Historical data indicates humans once utilized numerical sequences and tonal variations for emotional expression and musical creation. Thus, this device also functioned as a musical instrument.		2016		
2016	5145	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	"For example, I came across an auditory pattern logged as ""di-da-di-di-da-da-da-di-di-di-da-di""..."		2017		
2017	5145	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	What does this mean? Could you demonstrate and explain it to me in person today?		2018		
2018	5145	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HakamaNormal04.png	The evening breeze is quite chilly, so I have turned on the climate control system. You may... stay a little closer to me.				
2019	5146	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NuoanNormal01.png	I received the postcard. Thank you, Commandant.		2020		
2020	5146	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NuoanNormal01.png	I love it, though I can't help feeling a little regret... I thought the gift I sent would reach you first.		2021		
2021	5146	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NuoanNormal01.png	It's not about competition—I just wanted you to feel that joy before I did.		2022		
2022	5146	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NuoanNormal01.png	Remember that cave we explored together? You mentioned how special the rocks were, so I collected some smaller pieces and made this stone lamp.		2023		
2023	5146	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NuoanNormal01.png	I still recall you saying how even the faintest light in total darkness could bring warmth to one's heart.		2024		
2024	5146	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NuoanNormal01.png	Like when we looked up at the cave ceiling and imagined ourselves adrift in a sea of stars.		2025		
2025	5146	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NuoanNormal01.png	But what matters most are the memories we made there together.		2026		
2026	5146	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NuoanNormal01.png	Every step we took side by side, every hope we shared for the future—they've become the most precious treasures of this journey.		2027		
2027	5146	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NuoanNormal01.png	I hope this lamp reminds you of those moments, too.				
2028	5147	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	Commandant, the thing you sent... Bambinata has received it.		2029		
2029	5147	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	"Mistress says it is called a ""postcard,"" used to capture beautiful sights and the sender's words."		2030		
2030	5147	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	Bambinata knows... the picture is of that sea. The sea we saw together. So the photo and words must both be beautiful, yes?		2031		
2031	5147	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	You said yu felt free and weightless around the sea... like fish darting, like seagulls skimming waves.		2032		
2032	5147	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	"Bambinata doesn't understand ""freedom,"" but you told Bambinata that it feels the same when Bambinata dances."		2033		
2033	5147	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	So Bambinata... wants to give Commandant... freedom too.		2034		
2034	5147	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	"Bambinata remembers the word ""weightless,"" so Bambinata asked Mistress: What is the lightest thing in the world?"		2035		
2035	5147	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	Mistress said it's clouds, soft puffs floating in the sky. So... Bambinata found one. A tiny cloud.		2036		
2036	5147	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	The sea is blue. The sky is blue.		2037		
2037	5147	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	Bambinata and Commandant saw fish swimming during the trip, so Bambinata shaped the cloud into a fish.		2038		
2038	5147	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	As a reply to the postcard... please accept this cloud Bambinata found, Commandant.				
2039	5148	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V220hyNormal01.png	Thank you for the postcard, Commandant. I will treasure it with care.		2040		
2040	5148	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V220hyNormal01.png	In return, I have made this pair of wax-resist dyed carps, using cloth as my canvas and wax as my ink.		2041		
2041	5148	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V220hyNormal01.png	It's meticulous work, every stroke demanding full focus.		2042		
2042	5148	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V220hyNormal01.png	Yet with each line I drew, my mind wandered to moments we have shared side by side.		2043		
2043	5148	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V220hyNormal01.png	Miraculously, the carps turned out flawless—even more exquisite than I had ever hoped.		2044		
2044	5148	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V220hyNormal01.png	May our hearts stay connected like these twin fish, always.		2045		
2045	5148	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V220hyNormal01.png	Next time you feel the sea breeze or spot a distant sail, may it bring back today's memories of us together.		2046		
2046	5148	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V220hyNormal01.png	That would be my greatest wish.				
2047	5157	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2130hyNormal01.png	Thank you for the postcard, Commandant. I will treasure it with care.		2048		
2048	5157	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2130hyNormal01.png	In return, I have made this pair of wax-resist dyed carps, using cloth as my canvas and wax as my ink.		2049		
2049	5157	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2130hyNormal01.png	It's meticulous work, every stroke demanding full focus.		2050		
2050	5157	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2130hyNormal01.png	Yet with each line I drew, my mind wandered to moments we have shared side by side.		2051		
2051	5157	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2130hyNormal01.png	Miraculously, the carps turned out flawless—even more exquisite than I had ever hoped.		2052		
2052	5157	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2130hyNormal01.png	May our hearts stay connected like these twin fish, always.		2053		
2053	5157	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2130hyNormal01.png	Next time you feel the sea breeze or spot a distant sail, may it bring back today's memories of us together.		2054		
2054	5157	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2130hyNormal01.png	That would be my greatest wish.				
2055	5149	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	Man, this is some BS—I checked this damn yacht like a hundred times before we left! How the heck did it still break down?!		2056		
2056	5149	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	Called the rescue squad, but they won't get here till morning. Guess we're roughin' it on this deserted island tonight, partner.		2057		
2057	5149	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	But yo, you're way too chill about this! Look at all the crap you packed—travel kettle, multi-tool, survival kits... Wait, you didn't actually expect my ride to screw up, did ya?		2058		
2058	5149	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	Tch, whatever. Since you bothered to bring me a postcard, I'll let it slide.		2059		
2059	5149	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	Speaking of gifts, check this out! Scored this rock vinyl at the beach market. Tracks'll blow your ears off! Almost lost it when the yacht went down, but your partner here fished it out last second.		2060		
2060	5149	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	Wanna listen to it? Oh wait... no player.		2061		
2061	5149	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	No sweat! Got every note memorized. Ain't no way we're skipping tunes on a special day like this!		2062		
2062	5149	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V240nktNormal01.png	Time for my one-man concert! Brace yourself, Commandant—we headbanging till sunrise!				
2063	5150	1	Echo	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V250ylsNormal01.png	Though I have already expressed my gratitude upon receiving your postcard, I feel my thanks at the time were not conveyed with proper formality. Please allow me to reiterate my appreciation again through this mail.		2064		
2064	5150	1	Echo	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V250ylsNormal01.png	I have read and reread your postcard, and each time I can clearly sense the sincerity imbued within its words. As etiquette dictates, I wished to reciprocate with a gift of equal thoughtfulness.		2065		
2065	5150	1	Echo	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V250ylsNormal01.png	Thus, I crafted this beach diorama, inscribing verses born of our journey along the inner side of its lid.		2066		
2066	5150	1	Echo	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V250ylsNormal01.png	Initially, I had planned to present it to you during dinner this evening.		2067		
2067	5150	1	Echo	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V250ylsNormal01.png	Yet, as the moment arrived, I found myself overcome with the sense that no physical token could fully convey the depth of my feelings.		2068		
2068	5150	1	Echo	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V250ylsNormal01.png	Cecily offered counsel: sometimes, words may be a more direct form of expression.		2069		
2069	5150	1	Echo	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V250ylsNormal01.png	Now I write from my balcony, surrounded by silence save for the starlit sky stretching endlessly above.		2070		
2070	5150	1	Echo	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V250ylsNormal01.png	So, Commandant... might you come to my room?		2071		
2071	5150	1	Echo	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V250ylsNormal01.png	I wish to read this poem to you in person beneath these very stars.				
2072	5151	1	Lamia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V260lmyNormal01.png	I got your postcard... You're so good at writing. We saw the same view, but I could never describe it like you did...		2073		
2073	5151	1	Lamia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V260lmyNormal01.png	I'll keep it with me and read it every night until I memorize it. Maybe next time I see another beautiful view, I'll be able to say something wonderful too, just like you.		2074		
2074	5151	1	Lamia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V260lmyNormal01.png	"Oh, about that video you asked me about... the one everyone on the ship is talking about, with the ""mysterious mermaid"" dancing underwater..."		2075		
2075	5151	1	Lamia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V260lmyNormal01.png	Actually... that was me.		2076		
2076	5151	1	Lamia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V260lmyNormal01.png	I heard an old local legend about mermaids dancing beneath the waves to bless brave sailors on their journeys.		2077		
2077	5151	1	Lamia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V260lmyNormal01.png	So I... wanted to learn that dance. For you.		2078		
2078	5151	1	Lamia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V260lmyNormal01.png	But then someone filmed me practicing, and now the whole ship has seen it... I need to go dunk myself in the water to cool off just thinking about it...		2079		
2079	5151	1	Lamia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V260lmyNormal01.png	The video you saw was taken from really far away, so it's blurry, but I have a clearer recording I made closer up...		2080		
2080	5151	1	Lamia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V260lmyNormal01.png	I've been practicing a lot, so... it's... maybe okay now? If you still can't see it clearly, you could... um... come into the water, and I'll swim closer to dance for you...				
2081	5152	1	Teddy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2100boxNormal01.png	Got your postcard. Guess we're weirdly in sync when it comes to holiday gifts.		2082		
2082	5152	1	Teddy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2100boxNormal01.png	Wanna take a wild guess what I got you?		2083		
2083	5152	1	Teddy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2100boxNormal01.png	Here's a hint: remember that mechanical conch I brought over, the one that's always buzzing around us?		2084		
2084	5152	1	Teddy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2100boxNormal01.png	Ta-da—it's actually a floating camera. I've recorded all the fun moments during our trip. Gonna edit the clips with some nice tracks and gift you as a momento.		2085		
2085	5152	1	Teddy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2100boxNormal01.png	"Oh, and there's plenty of your ""stellar"" performances in there. Buckle up."		2086		
2086	5152	1	Teddy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2100boxNormal01.png	Editing's pretty much done, but the whole thing still feels like it's missing one killer shot.		2087		
2087	5152	1	Teddy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2100boxNormal01.png	So here I am, filming at the bow, but no matter how many takes I do... something crucial's just not there.		2088		
2088	5152	1	Teddy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2100boxNormal01.png	Hey, Commandant—what's the missing piece, you think?				
2089	5153	1	Bridget	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2120bljtNormal01.png	Got your postcard, Commandant.		2090		
2090	5153	1	Bridget	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2120bljtNormal01.png	Not bad for a break from duty, huh?		2091		
2091	5153	1	Bridget	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2120bljtNormal01.png	Sea breeze, killer views, and the coldest drinks...		2092		
2092	5153	1	Bridget	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2120bljtNormal01.png	Heh... I had a blast with you. Still makes me smile just thinking about it.		2093		
2093	5153	1	Bridget	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2120bljtNormal01.png	Only shame we didn't get to try the real ocean sport together.		2094		
2094	5153	1	Bridget	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2120bljtNormal01.png	What kind? Diving, obviously!		2095		
2095	5153	1	Bridget	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2120bljtNormal01.png	Strapping on the gear, holding hands... Three, two, one—heroic splashdown!		2096		
2096	5153	1	Bridget	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2120bljtNormal01.png	Yeah, you're picturing it now, aren't you?		2097		
2097	5153	1	Bridget	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2120bljtNormal01.png	To make up for that missed chance, I'm gifting you something really special!		2098		
2098	5153	1	Bridget	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2120bljtNormal01.png	It's vintage dive gear from the Golden Age. Take good care of it for me, okay?				
2099	5160	1	Yata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2160bqNormal01.png	Phew— Can you see this, Commandant? I just got back from swimming.		2100		
2100	5160	1	Yata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2160bqNormal01.png	Found this postcard in my room. So that's why you kept asking me to take underwater photos. Not bad... kinda sentimental, I guess.		2101		
2101	5160	1	Yata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2160bqNormal01.png	But did you really have to be so mysterious about it? Could've just handed it to me directly. Well, guess what? I got you something too.		2102		
2102	5160	1	Yata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2160bqNormal01.png	"On Hydrangea Island, we give these ""lucky charms"" called omamori to travelers for safe journeys."		2103		
2103	5160	1	Yata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2160bqNormal01.png	...Here. Made you one. Edges are a bit messy... but I followed a tutorial for hours, okay?		2104		
2104	5160	1	Yata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2160bqNormal01.png	They say if you take an omamori to famous landmarks, it collects different blessings. So, I ran around hitting ALL TWELVE Hydrangea scenic spots for you.		2105		
2105	5160	1	Yata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2160bqNormal01.png	Now your charm's got TWELVE gods' protection—Travel God, Warrior God, Singer God, Food God... Wherever you go, smooth sailing guaranteed.		2106		
2106	5160	1	Yata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2160bqNormal01.png	...Kinda makes me wanna test it now. Put it on and let's play tennis—best two out of three, like always.		2107		
2107	5160	1	Yata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2160bqNormal01.png	Loser cooks dinner. Hurry up, I'll be waiting on the deck.				
2108	5162	1	Ishmael	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3000CbzNormal05.png	The nervous brush of fingertips, the heartbeat when eyes meet, the quiet relief of waking to find the one still there...		2109		
2109	5162	1	Ishmael	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3000CbzNormal05.png	Tangible things fade with time, but what lingers in memory are always these elusive fragments of emotion.		2110		
2110	5162	1	Ishmael	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3000CbzNormal05.png	Words can only carry so much information, yet as triggers for remembrance, they suffice. I shall treasure this postcard, and all the unspoken sentiments it holds.		2111		
2111	5162	1	Ishmael	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3000CbzNormal05.png	In return, I found you this prism pendant from the cruise ship's shop.		2112		
2112	5162	1	Ishmael	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3000CbzNormal05.png	A flaw in the craftsmanship left it veined with tiny fractures. But when I first saw it, something about those cracks seemed to hold a secret image.		2113		
2113	5162	1	Ishmael	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3000CbzNormal05.png	And indeed—when light strikes the pendant at just the right angle, the refracted patterns form the silhouette of a gray raven.		2114		
2114	5162	1	Ishmael	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3000CbzNormal05.png	When longed-for things appear at the perfect moment, is it mere coincidence or fate's design? Either way, Gray Raven... meeting you itself has been a singular grace.		2115		
2115	5162	1	Ishmael	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3000CbzNormal05.png	Ah, would you like to see how this pendant catches the evening light?		2116		
2116	5162	1	Ishmael	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3000CbzNormal05.png	Find me on the deck. Don't mind the gathering clouds. I believe... they'll part soon enough.				
2117	5163	1	Lilith	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3100llsNormal01.png	Care to make a bet with me?		2118		
2118	5163	1	Lilith	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3100llsNormal01.png	"I bet you won't dare to wear this... ""gift from the sea"" on your finger."		2119		
2119	5163	1	Lilith	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3100llsNormal01.png	Oh, show some faith in me, Commandant.		2120		
2120	5163	1	Lilith	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3100llsNormal01.png	After all, I did open the mail from Babylonia without hesitation.		2121		
2121	5163	1	Lilith	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3100llsNormal01.png	The cruise postcard you sent is well received—with such a collection of scenic photos attached.		2122		
2122	5163	1	Lilith	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3100llsNormal01.png	So, I've prepared a matching gift... salvaged from slightly deeper waters.		2123		
2123	5163	1	Lilith	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3100llsNormal01.png	Still hesitating? How dull. Shall I grant you another chance to thank me then?		2124		
2124	5163	1	Lilith	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3100llsNormal01.png	Take a guess—which passenger aboard that ship was truly me?		2125		
2125	5163	1	Lilith	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3100llsNormal01.png	And here's a little hint: That morning you woke up groggy in your cabin, didn't you notice...		2126		
2126	5163	1	Lilith	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3100llsNormal01.png	That the female bartender's cocktail left a... familiar aftertaste on your tongue?				
2127	5165	1	Jetavie	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3300jtwNormal02.png	I've got your postcard, which means... you finally woke up, Chosen One.		2128		
2128	5165	1	Jetavie	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3300jtwNormal02.png	That blank look on your face... You already forgot?		2129		
2129	5165	1	Jetavie	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3300jtwNormal02.png	You actually fell asleep while we were strolling along the beach!		2130		
2130	5165	1	Jetavie	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3300jtwNormal02.png	Honestly, you have zero sense of caution. Limbs all sprawled out, breathing so steady, snoozing just like a baby...		2131		
2131	5165	1	Jetavie	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3300jtwNormal02.png	Was lying in my arms really that comforting?		2132		
2132	5165	1	Jetavie	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3300jtwNormal02.png	The white noise of the ocean waves easily lulls humans to sleep—you sure proved that point right.		2133		
2133	5165	1	Jetavie	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3300jtwNormal02.png	I've recorded the sound using this Walkman for you... and a little lullaby from me.		2134		
2134	5165	1	Jetavie	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3300jtwNormal02.png	When you listen to it, you'd better rest properly.		2135		
2135	5165	1	Jetavie	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3300jtwNormal02.png	I can't wait to see just how many more of those sleepy faces you'll show me...				
2136	20006	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3400wlNormal12.png	An illegal program? You dare drag me into this place. Reckless.		2137		
2137	20006	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3400wlNormal12.png	It seems I can only move by the established rules in this chess game.		2138		
2138	20006	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3400wlNormal12.png	Then by your own demand, I shall deliver unto you absolute ruin!				
2139	20007	1	Wrench Boy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiBlackRockChess/banshou01.png	Heehee, if I win, how about you give me that human commandant of yours?		2140		
2140	20007	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3400wlNormal12.png	Funny. I'd love to see...		2141		
2141	20007	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3400wlNormal12.png	...if you'll keep daydreaming after I turn you into metal scrap.				
2142	20008	1	Shark Lord	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShashibierNormal04.png	You smell delicious.		2143		
2143	20008	1	Shark Lord	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShashibierNormal04.png	Become a gingerbread-flavored chess piece and stay forever on the board!		2144		
2144	20008	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3400wlNormal12.png	I'm never a fan of playing house. Get out of my way!				
2145	20009	1	Shark Lord	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/ShashibierNormal04.png	Boohoo... You can have all the treasures! Stop it!		2146		
2146	20009	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3400wlNormal12.png	Ugh, it's still not over yet?		2147		
2147	20009	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3400wlNormal12.png	[Stranger, if you are reading this message, please be careful. My sister and I haven't been able to fully destroy this program. It keeps rebooting itself and changing the rules every once in a while. No matter what its intention is, you are being watched.]		2148		
2148	20009	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3400wlNormal12.png	Being watched? What does that mean?		2149		
2149	20009	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3400wlNormal12.png	Mmph?!		2150		
2150	20009	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3400wlNormal12.png	Dammit, I've been tricked... My perception and memories in the illusion are fading... So that's how it stayed hidden?!		2151		
2151	20009	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3400wlNormal12.png	Next in line... You'd better not drop the baton.				
2152	100	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	Good. Looks like that bit of rest didn't make you slack off.		2153		
2153	100	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	Everything you just saw came from your past mission briefings.		2154		
2154	100	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	Don't get careless. This mission review isn't over yet.		2155		
2155	100	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	Think of it as a little refresher, to get you back in the groove.		2156		
2156	100	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	The missions ahead will be even tougher.				
2157	103	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Commandant, did going through these logs remind you how Construct upgrades work?		2158		
2158	103	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	Every fight makes us a little stronger, a little sharper.		2159		
2159	103	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	If you keep leveling me up, I'll be able to fight even better.		2160		
2160	103	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuxiyaNormal01.png	In the missions to come, please see for yourself how much stronger I've become.				
2161	104	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Hello there, Commandant of Gray Ravens. I'm Celica, Secretary of the Babylonia Parliament.		2162		
2162	104	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	The briefing you're looking at now marks where we first began fighting side by side.		2163		
2163	104	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Back then, things were urgent. I had to walk you through the combat process right away, so I got straight to the point.		2164		
2164	104	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	We've set some starter objectives for every new squad. Finish them and you'll get plenty of supplies.		2165		
2165	104	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Everything we do is to help new beginners find their footing and set out with confidence.				
2166	114	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	Commandant, Inver-Shards can be used to promote your characters.		2167		
2167	114	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	You can also get Inver-Shards through research.		2168		
2168	114	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal01.png	The supply center has prepared Inver-Shards for Lucia: Lotus. Please pick them up soon.				
2169	26	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	That's everything for Operation Graffiti.		2170		
2170	26	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	How are you feeling? Starting to get back into your old rhythm?		2171		
2171	26	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	You now have full access to all mission briefings.		2172		
2172	26	1	Hassen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/HasangNomal01.png	Babylonia still faces many threats. Keep leading Gray Raven forward.				
2173	5	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Hello there, Commandant of Gray Raven. You're one of F.O.S. College's top graduates.		2174		
2174	5	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	By now, I'm sure you've gotten used to fighting alongside the Constructs again.		2175		
2175	5	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Hmm? You mean there are still a few combat tricks you haven't quite picked up yet?		2176		
2176	5	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Don't worry. I've prepared a short review of the F.O.S. College lessons to help refresh your memory.		2177		
2177	5	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	I've also set up a few small exercises so you can practice and understand things better.		2178		
2178	5	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailikaNomal01.png	Then keep training, and get more familiar with different combat styles.				
2179	8	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	Gray Raven Commandant, I'm Asimov.		2180		
2180	8	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	There's a new combat research mission that needs your help.		2181		
2181	8	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	Just a heads-up, these missions aren't like the usual ones. They're tougher and more complicated, so stay sharp.		2182		
2182	8	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	These challenges will help improve your command skills and adaptability. They'll push your combat performance to the next level.		2183		
2183	8	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/AximofuNomal01.png	And I hope you can last a bit longer this time. It's not just about testing you—it also gives me more combat data to analyze.				
9300001	2031	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3kuluomuNormal02.png	On desperate seas long wont to roam... Thy Naiad airs have brought me home, and the grandeur of old Rome.		9300002		
9300002	2031	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3kuluomuNormal02.png	We've trudged through seas and their savage waves, Commandant, and here we are now enjoying ourselves in the sun by the sea. I'm glad we get to spend such a peaceful time together.		9300003		
9300003	2031	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R3kuluomuNormal02.png	I hope l will one day be able to give this peaceful sea back to you.				
9600001	96000010	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	*Connection request from Chrome through a private channel*		9600002		
9600002	96000010	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	Commandant, I hope I'm not bothering you.		9600003		
9600003	96000010	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	I've heard that today is the day people express their most heartfelt feelings. I... Strike Hawk has been in your care the whole time, so I would like to express my thanks today.		9600004		
9600004	96000010	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	I have prepared a little something. I hope you'd like it.		9600005		
9600005	96000010	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KuluomuNormal01.png	I wasn't sure what type of chocolate you might prefer, so I've prepared different types and flavors. I hope you find one that you like.Well, then... Happy Valentine's Day, KURONAME.				
9600006	96000011	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	I heard that today you send your important ones gifts.		9600007		
9600007	96000011	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	And they say this is the most fitting one.		9600008		
9600008	96000011	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2SufeiyaNormal01.png	Commandant... Do you like it?				
9600009	96000012	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	Hey hey, my little birdling. How's it been? Today's Valentine's, you'd know, won't you?		9600010		
9600010	96000012	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	Hah. I know. You're expecting something... special on a day like this, aren'tcha?		9600011		
9600011	96000012	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	Something like... This piece of chocolate, a piece that's so sweet that it hurts?		9600012		
9600012	96000012	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2WeilaNormal01.png	Ahaha. Take it. When you pop it in your mouth, don't forget who granted you this pain.				
9600013	96000013	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Finally. Took you long enough. Well, Gray Raven Commandant, you know what day it is.		9600014		
9600014	96000013	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Yep. The day to show your feelings to important ones. Kamui's been nagging me on all day, ignoring the guy wasn't an option.		9600015		
9600015	96000013	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Here. Take this. Guess you'd expected something like this. I've tried several ways of making it and there's been quite a few failed products, but eating them up was kinda fun.		9600016		
9600016	96000013	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Valentine? Nah, I'm not interested in calling it this way or whatever.		9600017		
9600017	96000013	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/R2KamuNormal01.png	Unlike that guy, I know what I want. I wouldn't sully such an important matter in such a petty way.				
9600018	2032	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/21haoNormal01.png	The sea breeze somehow tastes a little... sweet...		9600019		
9600019	2032	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/21haoNormal01.png	Is it because you're standing right beside me? I don't dislike that it's sweet, though.		9600020		
9600020	2032	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/21haoNormal01.png	Next time, can we just look at the sea again... Yes, standing.				
9600021	2033	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WeilaSNormal01.png	I've uploaded the pictures we took at Venus Splash Park. Did you see your face in the pictures?		9600022		
9600022	2033	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WeilaSNormal01.png	Wait, does it still bother you that I stole that one spoonful of smoothie from you?... Yes, I did it with your spoon. So what?		9600023		
9600023	2033	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WeilaSNormal01.png	Talking back to me now, huh? Great. I like that.		9600024		
9600024	2033	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/WeilaSNormal01.png	"Come over here. I've got you ""a little something"" to make it up to you. You gotta finish it all, though."				
9600025	2034	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	Hey, how did you like the haunted house, Commandant?		9600026		
9600026	2034	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	That was our first time working together during an escape, wasn't it? We worked so well together, though. It was like...		9600027		
9600027	2034	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	Huh? Did I say something wrong? Hey, I don't know anything.		9600028		
9600028	2034	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuolanNormal04.png	...Well, how about let's do it again?				
9600029	2035	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal04.png	It's quite an experience looking at Venus Splash Park from up above, Commandant.		9600030		
9600030	2035	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal04.png	You can see every inch of it so clearly with nothing standing in the way.		9600031		
9600031	2035	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LifuNormal04.png	Before I became part of Gray Raven, I never dreamed that I'd one day be able to see this beautiful world this way.				
9600032	2036	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal07.png	Tis the time of the year when all flowers shine in bloom—save for the iris.		9600033		
9600033	2036	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal07.png	Warmth, sunlight, and rain dew—all these gifts help the seeds and plants get through the excruciating cold of the winter, beyond which they shine in beauty.		9600034		
9600034	2036	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal07.png	"I heard the day is all about ""giving out of love"", and I suppose we can't ask for better gifts from these flowers than their beauty and resilience."		9600035		
9600035	2036	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/SailinnaNormal07.png	Do allow me to bring home some fresh flowers for you, Conductor. They might not be the most precious things in the world and they certainly won't last for long, but I hope you will like them all the same.				
9600036	96000030	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NuoanNormal01.png	Since you have come to meet me today as promised, I'll hold up my end and give you the deleted footage.		9600037		
9600037	96000030	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NuoanNormal01.png	But... you looked tired when you arrived. Are you still this busy lately?		9600038		
9600038	96000030	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NuoanNormal01.png	This heap of problems isn't created by one person. Just because they are assigned to you doesn't mean they're your sole responsibility.		9600039		
9600039	96000030	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/NuoanNormal01.png	Growing up in solitude might bring you merits but also vices... Lean on the people around you a little more, Commandant. Rely on me a little more.				
9600040	96000031	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	Bambinata has received the gift and will pass it to Mistress safely, Commandant... Huh? It's for Bambinata?		9600041		
9600041	96000031	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	Please wait, Commandant. Bambinata is checking the reminder module.		9600042		
9600042	96000031	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	Ah... Today is the day people exchange gifts with those who are important to them. The notification module of Bambinata's reminder system was damaged, and…		9600043		
9600043	96000031	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	…Sincerest apologies, Commandant. Bambinata should have prepared a gift for you on this important day, but Bambinata has forgotten about the promise...		9600044		
9600044	96000031	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bbntNormal01.png	I-if you don't mind, Commandant, Bambinata would love to make it up to you in other ways...				
9600045	96000032	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bakNormal01.png	Thank you for your gift, Commandant.		9600046		
9600046	96000032	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bakNormal01.png	I don't know why, but every time I watch this movie, it always reminds me of you, Commandant.		9600047		
9600047	96000032	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bakNormal01.png	I'll let you have the soundtrack of the movie. And if possible...		9600048		
9600048	96000032	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V130bakNormal01.png	May I ask you to watch the classic scenes in it with me today?				
9600049	96000033	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V132lNormal01.png	Do you have time at the moment, Commandant?		9600050		
9600050	96000033	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V132lNormal01.png	...Nothing special. It's just I want you to have this tutorial CD.		9600051		
9600051	96000033	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V132lNormal01.png	...Do I know what day today is? Ahem, I just randomly grabbed it. It's not something I specially prepared.		9600052		
9600052	96000033	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V132lNormal01.png	Of course this is to prevent you from imposing unreasonable demands on me. I can't conjure up anything out of thin air anytime and anywhere, Commandant.		9600053		
9600053	96000033	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V132lNormal01.png	You didn't answer my question. Do you have time now?		9600054		
9600054	96000033	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V132lNormal01.png	About the weapon extension add-on module you asked about... I researched on it a bit. Find me in the lounge if you still want it.				
9600055	96000034	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V200alNormal01.png	Happy White Day, Commandant!		9600056		
9600056	96000034	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V200alNormal01.png	It's said that it's a day to express love.		9600057		
9600057	96000034	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V200alNormal01.png	Although it is a convention passed on from the Golden Age, it remains a commonplace practice for everyone to celebrate.		9600058		
9600058	96000034	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V200alNormal01.png	Thank you for the gift, Commandant! In return, I'll let you have the best work of mine!		9600059		
9600059	96000034	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V200alNormal01.png	Do you like it, Commandant? Because you've got a pretty smile on your face! Yeah, just like that! Cheese! Just look forward to my new work, Commandant!				
9600060	96000035	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V210aefNormal01.png	Another meaningless gift... You are hopeless.		9600061		
9600061	96000035	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V210aefNormal01.png	Alright. I guess I'll have to give you something in return.		9600062		
9600062	96000035	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V210aefNormal01.png	I happened to have recorded something boring. Hmm... I think it's okay to let you have a look.		9600063		
9600063	96000035	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V210aefNormal01.png	I can get you down here from Babylonia if you want to see it with your own eyes.				
9600064	96000036	1	Echo	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V200hyNormal01.png	Thank you for your gift, Commandant.		9600065		
9600065	96000036	1	Echo	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V200hyNormal01.png	I'm aware that... during a special festival like this, gifts often hold deeper significance. That's why I also dedicated considerable thought to selecting a suitable gift in return.		9600066		
9600066	96000036	1	Echo	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V200hyNormal01.png	However, Cecily tells me not to be overly bound by formalities, as the act of giving itself is enough to express one's appreciation... I believe that if you were in a similar situation, you would likely offer me the same advice.		9600067		
9600067	96000036	1	Echo	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V200hyNormal01.png	I chose to give you this Bluestar Tweedia, as it symbolizes trust and luck. It is through our encounter that I have found a sense of direction and the courage to embrace my true self.		9600068		
9600068	96000036	1	Echo	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V200hyNormal01.png	Cecily mentioned that this tiny blue flower bears a resemblance to my appearance. Whenever you catch a glimpse of it, I hope it reminds you of me.		9600069		
9600069	96000036	1	Echo	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V200hyNormal01.png	While I, in return, will use it as a way to express my longing and deep appreciation for you in every passing moment.		9600070		
9600070	96000036	1	Echo	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V200hyNormal01.png	As my study of the poetry from the Golden Age continues, I came across a poem that I found particularly fitting recently, and I wanted to share it with you.		9600071		
9600071	96000036		Echo	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V200hyNormal01.png	Thank you for your gift again, and I wanted to let you know that each day spent with you brings me immense joy.				
9600072	96000037	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2140wssNormal01.png	Mmm, you were the one who placed the cookies outside the Strike Hawk's maintenance chamber, weren't you?		9600073		
9600073	96000037	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2140wssNormal01.png	I saw them right as I got up to leave. As to how I figured out it was you...		9600074		
9600074	96000037	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2140wssNormal01.png	Would you believe me if I said I saw it in my dream?		9600075		
9600075	96000037	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2140wssNormal01.png	They taste great. It was perfect as the first meal after a full night's sleep.		9600076		
9600076	96000037	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2140wssNormal01.png	For my gift in return... How about this?		9600077		
9600077	96000037	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2140wssNormal01.png	"A bottle of ""emergency mood boosters"" exclusive from me. I guarantee that all your problems will be solved after you take one."		9600078		
9600078	96000037	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2140wssNormal01.png	I'm not treating you like a child. It's a scientific fact that sugar makes you happy.		9600079		
9600079	96000037	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2140wssNormal01.png	When I'm not by your side, take a booster and cheer up.		9600080		
9600080	96000037	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2140wssNormal01.png	And when I'm by your side...		9600081		
9600081	96000037	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V2140wssNormal01.png	"This doctor is going to do all he can to ""cure"" his patient."
