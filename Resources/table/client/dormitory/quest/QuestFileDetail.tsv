We had an argument about human nature—she thought it was self-destruction, while I thought it was survival. Looking back, I feel everything was predetermined, but this is not important anymore. I\'m just a bit lost. Maybe because the mission to hunt down Lucy took too much time. Now that she has disappeared, who will be my next target?'}"

I'll just write about the story of my friend.\\nAuntie Linda, as I called her, worked as a CPF maintenance technician. After her persistent efforts, her request for supplies and a rebuilding team was finally approved on her 44th birthday by Babylonia. This allowed her and her friend to return to the conservation area where she used to live.\\nThat wasn't an ideal place to live in, particularly for the elderly and vulnerable, but she was determined to rebuild it.\\nShe believed that the aftermath of the Pulia Forest Park disaster still lingered and felt a personal responsibility to contribute, especially considering it was where her husband had lost his life while protecting her when the calamity erupted.\\nFollowing that, we didn't communicate for about six months. When I heard from her again, it was about the untimely death of her friend, under mysterious circumstances. He vanished while sitting in the CPF, only to be found ten miles away, with half of his body devoured by Hetero-Creatures.\\nAuntie Linda always said it was no accident. According to her, someone coveted the rebuilding project and sought to take control after realizing it wasn't as perilous as rumored. She and her friend had rejected them, and shortly after, the unfortunate incident occurred.\\nAs the task of managing the entire rebuilding team became overwhelming, Auntie Linda eventually still agreed to collaborate with others. However, a person aware of the inner workings, a remnant of the past like her, was nothing but an eyesore to them.\\nThey would sneer at her, questioning how her friend could have died if she had been diligently watching over the CPF. They would mockingly remark that if she had agreed earlier and with more people involved, his death could have been avoided.\\n\\n(It seems there's a second page of this letter...)""}"

Whenever she approached the CPF, others would dismiss her, saying either, ""Just leave it, Auntie Linda!"" or ""Let the professional handle it. Just leave it, Auntie Linda!""\\nI suggested she leave the place, but she said it\'d be hard finding another technical job at her age, given her tendency to make errors in precision technology work. Moreover, this conservation area was her home.\\nIn an effort to gain acceptance from the team that treated her as an outsider, Auntie Linda discovered that the leader coveted an antique painting from the Golden Age. She learned that he would agree to anything if someone presented him with that painting as a gift.\\n...I\'m still unsure how she managed to get her hands on that painting. The last time we met, she had lost four teeth, yet she cheerfully told me that the painting had been given away. Initially, the boss seemed reluctant, but upon feeling her sincerity, he eventually accepted it.\\nAfter that encounter, I never saw Auntie Linda again, except to learn of her tragic fate. On the morning the rebuilding of the conservation area was completed, she leaped from the roof of a building.\\nWhen I rushed to the scene, her blood had vanished, covered by the red carpet where the host stood during the rebuilding celebration.\\n...\\nI couldn\'t understand what exactly happened to her as she couldn\'t understand why her friend was found dead ten miles away, but now I can.\\nThat\'s why I\'m here.'}"
