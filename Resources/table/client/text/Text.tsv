DormDesSecond	"Dormitory comfort contains Beauty, Comfort and Practicality, and different mates prefer different stats.\nEnter the warehouse to check the stats that the Constructs/Transcendants/Corrupted/Humans prefer. Comfort can improve the Stamina recovery speed of the Construct (Note:. If the stats your mate prefers is high, Mood can also be restored).\nOnly one Dormitory is unlocked at the beginning, then you can use Decor tokens to unlock other Dormitories one by one. Each Dormitory can support up to 3 mates.\n\nYou can buy Decors from the shop (Note: the stats of any decor in the shop is fixed), or obtain via build/refit.\nYou can only build ""Basic Decor Set"", and can define its stats by yourself.\nRefit means you can change the appearance of any decor by spending the corresponding blueprint (may have special effects).\n\nMates with high Mood can regularly send gifts to you. So try your best to increase the Mood of your mates."
DormDesWork	Expend Stamina of Constructs to do chores for Dorm Coins.\nEach Chore done will use almost all of a Construct's Stamina.\nStamina spent affects the output of Dorm Coins.\nChore attempts can be increased through unlocking more Dormitories.\nChore attempts reset at 05:00 UTC daily.
