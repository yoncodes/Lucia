The exile, hearing this clarity, feels a soul-deep pull toward the osmanthus shadows of home; the wanderer, bathed in its glow, finds solace in memories of jade towers and marble courts. Here, the pipa is more than an instrument; it is the full moon itself, a jade wheel hung in the vault of heaven. And with every plucked string, an autumnal longing is unveiled, luminous and profound.

The poisonous serpents gather in caves, beheld by the umbrella-wielder. With a flourish of the hand, the flowers scatter in a kaleidoscopic performance; with a lightning strike, the beast is felled. The beautiful garment hides under the open umbrella, leaving behind the mourns of a lost soul.

12590001	5	5901	Eternal Slumbering Sands	Wandering Ballad — Lance	Across the sea of sand, the lance stands like a stele from a forgotten age, shearing the veil between life and death. It conducts the soul-fires of the eternally exiled—those caught in futile struggle—into an absolute and final silence. Here, there are no hymns, no lamentations. Even death's last echo is swallowed by the inexorable sands, becoming mere sustenance for the void. As grit grinds on grit, all sound bleeds into stillness... This is the desert of death's most searing curse: to choose silence as the obliterating dunes consume you... or to become silence itself.
