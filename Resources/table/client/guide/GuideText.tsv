53003006	Asimov	First, let me give you some simple instructions.
53003134	Asimov	Your current mission objective is displayed in the top-left corner of your vision. Your progress will be updated in real-time.
53003135	Asimov	We need to explore the virtual space inside Gestalt to find the source of its deviation.
53003137	Asimov	Time is running out, so let's finish the investigation in Redundant Block 22-16!
53003138	Asimov	Before you now is the battle interface created by the Spear of F.O.S. after its tactic optimization and digitization.
53003140	Asimov	[Advance] indicates the safest path it can come up with after analyzing your environment, so start exploring that way.
53003143	Asimov	It will also stop you from entering the area. It might be a little harsh, but it's for your safety.
53003145	Asimov	Just go around the [Block] area when you see them.
53003146	Asimov	Sometimes you will find blind spots with unidentified data. Accidents are prone to happen there, so the Spear of F.O.S. has labeled them with [Block].
53003149	Asimov	You're getting the hang of it pretty quick. Now's your turn to make your own tactical decisions.
53003153	Asimov	Uncertain events create hazards on the field. Your system will label them with an orange area.
53003157	Asimov	Before you confront them, you should send the right [Connector] to perform [Calculation].
53003158	Asimov	The Spear of F.O.S. will analyze and categorize the different [Connector] powers and strengths into three groups.
53003160	Asimov	Different tactics come with different risk levels. They will be labeled at the bottom of the calculations.
53003161	Asimov	Based on the assessment from the Spear of F.O.S., calculating with [Perception] in our current event will generate higher risks.
53003162	Asimov	It might be a little too abstract for you to understand, so let's take the situation you are in as an example.
53003163	Asimov	After deciding on a tactic, choose [Confirm] and enter the calculation phase.
53003164	Asimov	What displays here is the risk level when you perform the tactic.
53003165	Asimov	For Lee, the Spear of F.O.S. has designated him as a Connector that excels in [Arithmetic]... Well, that's pretty accurate.
53003166	Asimov	And the assessment rating easily exceeds the risk level. Not too bad.
53003167	Asimov	After confirming the Connector you choose, click [Begin Emulation] to plan how your tactic will play out.
53003168	Asimov	Click [Confirm Result] afterward to find out what happens when you perform the tactic in your calculation.
53003170	Asimov	We are nearly at the end of this area. Nothing seems to be out of the ordinary so far.
53003172	Asimov	...Unidentified data, but it doesn't seem to be the culprit of Gestalt's deviations.
53003174	Asimov	I'll record it to study later. Now, click [Confirm Result] to finish this calculation.
53003176	Asimov	Not bad. You're adapting quite quickly. This will buy us some time.
53003178	Asimov	The situation remains urgent. After confirming that there is no abnormality with the last part here, immediately proceed to the next area.
53003179	Asimov	Compared to theories, actual experiences will let you attune to the Spear of F.O.S. much faster.
53003180	Asimov	Let's start your investigation with Redundant Block 22-16. It's the closest Block from where you've immersed.
53003183	Asimov	Head to the safer path and [Advance].
53003185	Asimov	Calculate your chosen tactic, and the Spear of F.O.S. will assess your plan and project the possible outcome.
53003187	Asimov	Your options are [Battle], [Perception], and [Arithmetic] respectively.
53003189	Asimov	Let's approach it with [Arithmetic] and perform the calculation.
53003191	Asimov	In front of you is a data fault. If we want to calculate it with [Arithmetic]...
53003192	Asimov	Use the right equation to calculate the formation sequence of the fault, find its origin point by how it's arranged, and then activate the sequence.
53003193	Asimov	This operation cannot fail. If you do, Gestalt will likely consider your action an anomaly invasion and proceed to eliminate you.
53003199	Asimov	So before you execute your tactic, it's much safer to find out the best equation for the [Arithmetic] program first.
53003202	Asimov	The Spear of F.O.S. will also provide a numerical rating for your Connector's tactic, allowing you to determine the feasibility of your plan.
53003204	Asimov	Try coming up with a tactic that rates higher than the risk level!
53003205	Asimov	In a moment, the Spear of F.O.S. will rate our plan and compare it to the risk level.
53004006	Celica	Commandant, you can enter Photo Mode to swap a scene once you unlock it.

60621065	Celica	This is a chaotic consciousness space with a total of <color=#57f0fb>six levels</color> from shallow to deep. Let's check out the first level, shall we?
60621067	Celica	Here shows the details of the current level you're on.
60621068	Celica	Let's go to the corresponding level.
60621070	Celica	Each consciousness level consists of multiple unstable zones. You must stabilize the current zone before linking to the next zone. The <color=#57f0fb>deeper</color> you advance, the <color=#57f0fb>stronger enemies</color> you'll face.
60621072	Celica	How about we stabilize the zone within 1km first?
60621079	Celica	Once you've cleared all unstable nodes, the zone will return stable.
60621081	Celica	If you find the enemies too strong to handle, you can try restructuring the nodes here.
60621083	Celica	You can instantly clear the cleared zones by spending dispatch attempts to get rewards. Dispatch attempts will <color=#57f0fb>reset at a fixed time</color> every day.
60622005	Celica	Here, you can equip the character with <color=#57f0fb>Add-ons</color>. Add-ons have powerful combat effects, but they'll cost a certain load as well.
60622065	Celica	To <color=#57f0fb>increase the load limit</color>, you need to get relevant items by clearing the unstable zones.
60623069	Celica	Spending <color=#57f0fb>Memory Synapses</color> obtained through battle can increase the team stats.
60623072	Celica	Each amplification stat shares the same limit, but it can be increased through the items obtained by clearing unstable zones.
60623074	Celica	The <color=#57f0fb>Configure Template</color> function can save your amplification setup as a template, so that you can quickly switch your amplification setup.
60623076	Celica	After selecting a character, the <color=#57f0fb>stat details</color> below will display the character's total stats (including equipped Add-ons).

61527108	Pulao	Let's begin!
61528030	Pulao	This is the <color=#57f0fb>Main City</color>. It's where our journey begins!
61528134	Pulao	Let's head to this <color=#57f0fb>city</color> first, Commandant. Reaching the city will make future trades <color=#57f0fb>more profitable</color>.
61528135	Pulao	Let's go, Commandant! Take your first step as a merchant!
61529030	Pulao	Now, let's move on to the key elements of being a merchant. The Main City will <color=#57f0fb>produce items</color> each quarter. Let's plan out this quarter's production.
61529114	Pulao	There are <color=#57f0fb>three types of items</color> in total. Each of them is different, but you can only <color=#57f0fb>produce one of them</color> each quarter.

61529135	Pulao	The <color=#57f0fb>estimated</color> <color=#57f0fb>total value</color> of producing an item in a quarter is displayed here based on its price and yield.
61529137	Pulao	Producing Crafts might seem modest at first, but the profit soars if a CRIT is triggered. It's my favorite item, so why don't we try it first?
61529139	Pulao	As a beginner bonus, let me increase the CRIT rate of the first two quarters for you, Commandant!
61529144	Pulao	We've done all we can do, and we're running out of <color=#57f0fb>Exploration Points</color>. They won't recover until <color=#57f0fb>next quarter</color>.
61529147	Pulao	Let's take a break and wait for the next quarter to <color=#57f0fb>recover our Exploration Points</color>!
61530030	Pulao	You CRIT! Getting a CRIT on your production will greatly increase this quarter's yield. You have a lot of <color=#57f0fb>Crafts</color> in stock right now. You're ready to <color=#57f0fb>trade</color> this quarter.
61530112	Pulao	Before trading, pay attention to how the price of each item <color=#57f0fb>fluctuates</color> in the quarter. Selling items when their price is higher will give you more Copper Coins.
61530120	Pulao	Before trading, pay attention to how the price of each item <color=#57f0fb>fluctuates</color> in the quarter. Selling items when their price is higher will give you more Copper Coins.

61531142	Pulao	Tap here to check an item's <color=#57f0fb>stock</color>!
61531151	Pulao	A CRIT is triggered! A <color=#57f0fb>production CRIT</color> will greatly <color=#57f0fb>increase this quarter's yield</color>. With so many Crafts in stock, we should prepare to <color=#57f0fb>trade</color>.
61531153	Pulao	Almost forgot. The <color=#57f0fb>price</color> of items <color=#57f0fb>fluctuates</color> within <color=#57f0fb>a certain range</color> each quarter. Remember to sell them when their price is higher.
61531157	Pulao	The price of Crafts this quarter is quite high at this moment due to the fluctuation. Try trading now!
61531162	Pulao	The Crafts sale this quarter is a <color=#57f0fb>guaranteed CRIT</color>. You should <color=#57f0fb>sell all of them</color>.
61532030	Pulao	Encountering Artifact Spaces during Exploration will award you <color=#57f0fb>Artifacts</color>, granting <color=#57f0fb>bonus effects</color> to our business and journey.

61534030	Pulao	We've reached a <color=#57f0fb>new city</color>. Establish trade with them to gain a massive <color=#57f0fb>item price bonus</color>.
61534112	Pulao	Each city has its own <color=#57f0fb>City Mission</color>. Completing the mission will gain their trust, and they will offer more <color=#57f0fb>extra bonuses</color>.
61534129	Pulao	I've marked the explorable <color=#57f0fb>cities</color> for you, Commandant. Remember to <color=#57f0fb>prioritize cities</color> during Exploration!

61537030	Pulao	I snooped around while we were building the Wishing Well, Commandant. The well will let you make a wish <color=#57f0fb>every few quarters</color> after it's built.
61537137	Pulao	There will be a <color=#57f0fb>notification</color> here if there are <color=#57f0fb>unused</color> wishes. Can I wish to become rich overnight, Commandant?

61710108	Celica	Welcome to <color=#57f0fb>Chess Wonderland</color>. This event is turn-based.
61710111	Celica	Use Luna to take on the white pieces. You win when <color=#57f0fb>the White King is defeated</color>!
61710112	Celica	When you finish a move, click on the attack icon to launch an attack.

61710153	Celica	Above a chess piece displays its remaining HP after the attack, and the damage dealt is displayed on the floor. Confirm to execute the attack.
61711108	Celica	In this stage, you will be taken through some basic information about the white pieces and strategies to cope with them.
61711111	Celica	When the white side is moving a piece, you can check its range of movement and the time left for it to finish its move by clicking on the piece.
61711112	Celica	The red zone is the area within which a white piece can move and attack. If <color=#57f0fb>Luna is in the red zone when a round is over, she falls prey to the white side.</color>
61711118	Celica	In the bottom right corner of the screen, you will see how many more rounds there are left until a piece can make a move. When <color=#57f0fb>you see the number become a movement icon, it means the piece is ready to make a move.</color>

61714158	Celica	Deploy Luna again to defeat the White King and win the match!

61717108	Celica	Reinforcement Illusions will occasionally appear on the board and enter the battle once the countdown ends. Keep an eye out for them!
61718108	Celica	Lucia has unlocked Drifting Shadow, which allows her to swap positions with Luna and deal damage.
61718111	Celica	Now, go on and finish the rest of the battle.

61704007	Lee	Commandant, as you can see, a new <color=#57f0fb>time frame mechanism</color> has been introduced in this stage. Let me walk you through it.
61704021	Lee	The stage is now divided into 4 time frames: <color=#57f0fb>Morning, Noon, Evening, and Night</color>.
61704022	Lee	The number below represents <color=#57f0fb>the remaining rounds within the current time frame</color>. Once all rounds are <color=#57f0fb>used up</color>, the stage will <color=#57f0fb>transition to the next time frame</color>.
61704024	Lee	Here shows the <color=#57f0fb>active time frame</color> for rules. When a rule is highlighted, it means it's effective in the current time frame.
61704027	Lee	We're currently in the <color=#57f0fb>[Morning]</color> time frame, so you need to decorate the Temple Fair according to <color=#57f0fb>rules effective during [Morning]</color>. Now, select the Market tile.
61704043	Lee	Confirm to <color=#57f0fb>place</color> the tile.
61704050	Lee	The time frame has shifted to <color=#57f0fb>[Noon]</color>. <color=#57f0fb>The tiles currently in place will only award points based on the rules effective during [Noon].</color>
61704052	Lee	Points awarded by rules effective during two time frames will be <color=#57f0fb>calculated separately for each of the two time frames</color>.
61704054	Lee	Total Score = <color=#57f0fb>points earned in the current time frame</color> + <color=#57f0fb>points calculated from previous time frames</color>
61704056	Lee	That's the end of the introduction. Let's finish the rest of the Temple Fair decoration together.
61705007	Bambinata	Bambinata wants to let you know that <color=#57f0fb>skipping</color> could be a good choice sometimes.
61730101	Shark-speare	Clearing <color=#57f0fb>Battle Nodes</color> during the calculation will accumulate <color=#57f0fb>Overflow Value</color>. Once it's full, <color=#57f0fb>Iterative Projection</color> will be triggered.
61730126	Shark-speare	It's totally fine if you're not getting it yet—it's not like I'm an expert either. Just give it a try first, and I'm sure you'll figure it out.
61730141	Shark-speare	Pick a difficulty level you want to tackle. If I were you, I'd choose with caution.
61731101	Shark-speare	Iterative Projection will offer three random characters, and you can pick one of them to <color=#57f0fb>gain a potent special effect</color> that will be active for <color=#57f0fb>the current calculation</color>.
61731126	Shark-speare	This effect seems pretty powerful. Choose the character for <color=#57f0fb>Iterative Projection</color> wisely.
61732101	Shark-speare	Invader... Welcome to... <color=#57f0fb>this world</color>...
61732155	Shark-speare	I suppose you have noticed it by now... There's this concept called <color=#57f0fb>Entropy</color> in this world... causing various ripples and effects...

61732159	Shark-speare	I suppose you have noticed it by now... There's this concept called <color=#57f0fb>Entropy</color> in this world... causing various ripples and effects...
61733101	Shark-speare	Invader... we meet again... However, things seem different... this time...
61733153	Shark-speare	Perhaps that higher existence... has something to do with it...
61733155	Shark-speare	Currently, this world and another world are... entangled... <color=#57f0fb>Entropy</color> of the two worlds will... influence each other...
61733157	Shark-speare	And it seems you possess the ability to <color=#57f0fb>travel freely</color> between the two worlds... Astounding... Could this too be the work of that one...?
61742152	Celica	At the start of each round, the <color=#57f0fb>Leader</color> will choose a difficulty. Keep in mind that the required <color=#57f0fb>member BP</color> and <color=#57f0fb>Activity</color> levels increase with difficulty.

61921136	Celica	We have also created new <color=#57f0fb>Perfect Tactics</color> effects based on the battlefield environment. Use them wisely.
61930101	Shark-speare	Greetings, the Chosen One. We have been ordered to add something new to the calculation.
61930126	Shark-speare	After choosing the <color=#57f0fb>Iteration Artifacts</color>, <color=#57f0fb>Collapse Points</color> will appear in the game. You can obtain items in the shop that increase the calculation difficulty and accumulate <color=#57f0fb>Calculation Peaks</color>.
61930128	Shark-speare	After each game, the <color=#57f0fb>highest</color> <color=#57f0fb>Calculation Peak</color> will be recorded here. <color=#57f0fb>Iteration Artifacts</color> of a higher difficulty will also be unlocked. Good luck!

61912159	Pulao	Tap sentences of different colors to <color=#57f0fb>delete the corresponding effects</color>.
61912167	Pulao	Use the Relic to <color=#57f0fb>delete sentences from the story</color> and remove the corresponding effects to <color=#57f0fb>weaken the enemy</color>.
61913136	Pulao	Sometimes, the stage may contain <color=#57f0fb>locked</color> words, which can be <color=#57f0fb>unlocked</color> after you use the Relic to <color=#57f0fb>delete certain sentences</color>.
61913159	Pulao	Clearing with <color=#57f0fb>unlocked words</color> will unlock <color=#57f0fb>hidden stage stories</color>.
61913171	Pulao	Tap <color=#57f0fb>Delete Sentence</color> to <color=#57f0fb>unlock the word</color>.
61940006	Lucia	Commandant, it's been a while. My workshop has finally opened a store in Kowloong. Come check it out.
61940215	Lucia	I have always wanted to collaborate with Kowloong to open a store with local flair. This wish has finally come true.
61940247	Lucia	<color=#57f0fb>Hanying</color> will be in charge this time, but I'll drop by whenever possible. Without further ado, let's hear what they are discussing.
61941249	Hanying	First, let's decide on what handcraft to <color=#57f0fb>sell</color> today.
61941251	Hanying	Select the handcraft to sell.
61941255	Hanying	Then assign a staff to sell it. Staff <color=#57f0fb>with bonuses</color> can generate higher income.
61941260	Hanying	Let's get familiar with the process of making a <color=#57f0fb>handcraft</color>.
61941270	Hanying	Welcome back to Working Lulu, Commandant!
61942006	Hanying	I have a secret to share with you.
61942249	Hanying	From <color=#57f0fb>daily missions</color>, you can get <color=#57f0fb>Special Sundials</color> that reduce the time required when used.
61943251	Pulao	<color=#57f1fb>Upgrade the store</color> to unlock more popular handcrafts! Earn as much as you can, Commandant! (=?ω｀=)
61944006	Pulao	Here's a tip, Commandant. You can tap the Swap button here to quickly swap Staff.
61944255	Pulao	Tap this Swap button to quickly swap the handcrafts/materials.
61946006	Pulao	Take a photo to record this busy moment, Commandant!
61946169	Pulao	Let's check out the <color=#57f1fb>Prep Station</color>!
61946173	Pulao	Make sure to tick all of our photo shooting objectives!
61946174	Pulao	Use the joystick to adjust your vision.
61946176	Pulao	Now press the shutter to take the photo.
61946185	Pulao	Welcome back to Working Lulu, Commandant!
61945006	Hanying	Commandant, the <color=#57f1fb>Buff</color> feature is now available.
61945256	Hanying	Here is an overview of the staff with active buffs and buff effects. Use them wisely with <color=#57f1fb>staff</color> skills to earn more <color=#57f1fb>income</color>.
61945265	Hanying	Welcome back to Working Lulu, Commandant!
61947006	Hanying	Upgrade the store to unlock more <color=#57f1fb>effects</color>, <color=#57f1fb>handcrafts</color>, and <color=#57f1fb>renovations</color>, as well as more store events or orders.
61947261	Hanying	Once you've met the upgrade conditions, you can upgrade the store with <color=#57f1fb>Lulu Dragon Coins</color>.
61948006	Hanying	Here's an <color=#57f1fb>order</color> from Lucia. We need to craft and deliver it.
61948259	Hanying	You can get <color=#57f1fb>hidden handcrafts</color> by completing customer orders.
61931101	Shark-speare	In the Collapse Points, you can get Artifacts that increase the calculation difficulty. After purchasing them, you will receive <color=#57f0fb>Processing Units</color> and <color=#57f0fb>Calculation Peaks</color>.
61949261	Hanying	The <color=#57f0fb>Crafting Station</color> is located further inside.
61949264	Hanying	Let's start <color=#57f0fb>crafting</color>.
61949268	Hanying	Select a handcraft to craft.
61949273	Hanying	Choose a staff with a bonus effect for this handcraft.
61949279	Hanying	At the very back is the <color=#57f0fb>Prep Station</color>. When it comes to material production, speed is the key.
61949281	Hanying	This is the final step in crafting.
61949283	Hanying	I suggest you choose a material that is <color=#57f0fb>currently being used</color>. It's always good to be prepared.
61949287	Hanying	Lulu's employees will not let us down.
61949298	Hanying	Welcome back to Working Lulu, Commandant!
62001006	Celica	Welcome to <color=#57f0fb>Special Dispatch - Coordinated Simulation</color>. In this operation, you will fight alongside all commandants in the server to clear the blocks and unlock bountiful rewards.
62001142	Celica	By clearing blocks, you can obtain <color=#57f0fb>server rewards</color> and unlock <color=#57f0fb>adjacent blocks</color>. Different types of blocks provide various <color=#57f0fb>server rewards</color>.
62001149	Celica	For more contents, please check out the Image Guide.
62001160	Celica	In addition, you can also get <color=#57f0fb>Trial Prototypes</color> from daily block battles and completing event missions, and exchange them for awesome rewards in <color=#57f0fb>Special Supplies</color>.
62001220	Celica	<color=#57f0fb>Special Missions</color> are a new feature in this operation, which requires your <color=#57f0fb>independent completion</color>. Complete these missions to obtain EXP and gradually unlock power bonuses.
62001221	Celica	Other teams may encounter dangers during their exploration. You can dispatch characters to <color=#57f0fb>support</color> them.
62001222	Celica	<color=#57f0fb>Special Missions</color> and <color=#57f0fb>Support Missions</color> refresh daily at 05:00 (UTC).
62021167	Celica	Commandant, welcome to <color=#57f0fb>Sweet Respite</color>. Let's help Wanshi arrange his schedule and achieve perfect sleep.
62021169	Celica	Let's begin with a short midday nap.
62021171	Celica	Tap to select a Sleep Time grid, and tap again to cancel selection.
62021173	Celica	After selecting a <color=#57f0fb>starting grid</color>, you can tap to select an adjacent time grid or <color=#57f0fb>hold and swipe</color> to select it.
62021175	Celica	Now that you have collected <color=#57f0fb>2 time units</color>, go ahead and try to execute this schedule.
62022171	Celica	Time grids that <color=#57f0fb>exceed</color> the Sleep Goal will <color=#57f0fb>remain after moving</color>. Select time grids from left to right and connect them to Wanshi to start his sleep.
62022190	Celica	Go ahead and finish the rest of the schedule planning.
62023171	Celica	When Kamui is in the room, he will repeatedly check if Wanshi really falls asleep. Apparently, this will only disrupt Wanshi's sleep.
62023173	Celica	The estimated sleep schedule will be <color=#57f0fb>extended by 3 time units</color>. Consequently, you need to allocate additional time to help Wanshi achieve his sleep goal.
62023197	Celica	Go ahead and finish the rest of the schedule planning.
62024185	Celica	When you select time grids and connect them to Chrome, the grids will be immediately cleared. However, Chrome will reserve <color=#57f0fb>1 time unit</color> for Wanshi's rest.
62024186	Celica	Chrome can help adjust the positions of other character events. When you find an event grid obstructing, you may try to relocate the event grid.
62024187	Celica	You don't have to trigger all character events. Plan the schedule wisely and make the most of the time.
62002142	Celica	Once a block has reached 100% progress, it will be cleared. You will then receive the corresponding <color=#57f0fb>server reward</color>.
62002143	Celica	You can participate in the battle by consuming Floating Computing Power. <color=#57f0fb>The higher the rating</color> you earn in a stage, <color=#57f0fb>the better the rewards</color> you will get.
62002149	Celica	Commandants who choose to dispatch <color=#57f0fb>do not need to actually take part in the battle</color>. They can simply consume Floating Computing Power to earn <color=#57f0fb>fixed rewards</color>.
62003142	Celica	Complete <color=#57f0fb>Special Missions</color> to obtain <color=#57f0fb>Operation Disks</color> and <color=#57f0fb>Simulation Disks</color>, which can be used to increase personal and server Dispatch Level.
62004142	Celica	Other teams may encounter dangers during their exploration. You can dispatch characters to <color=#57f0fb>support</color> them.
62004157	Celica	By offering support, you can obtain <color=#57f0fb>Scheduling Requests</color>. Consume <color=#57f0fb>Scheduling Requests</color> to immediately complete <color=#57f0fb>Special Missions</color>. You can only obtain support rewards <color=#57f0fb>twice</color> per day.
62006142	Celica	After clearing a <color=#57f0fb>Character Block</color>, you will receive the corresponding <color=#57f0fb>Special Character and Character Combat Amplification</color>.
62006143	Celica	Unlock and collect more Special Characters to earn bonus <color=#57f0fb>Trial Prototypes</color>.
62005142	Celica	If you have received support from other commandants the previous day, you can <color=#57f0fb>immediately claim</color> Special Mission rewards.
62005157	Celica	Don't forget to show your appreciation to the commandant who lends you a hand when you claim the rewards.
62007142	Celica	Completing <color=#57f0fb>Special Missions</color> and <color=#57f0fb>Support Missions</color> will increase your personal <color=#57f0fb>Dispatch Record</color> level, and the server-wide <color=#57f0fb>All-Realm Record</color> level.
62007157	Celica	By increasing your personal Dispatch Record level, you can unlock <color=#57f0fb>battle bonuses</color> and the <color=#57f0fb>Multi Challenge</color> feature.
62007161	Celica	The All-Realm Record level is shared by the server, providing <color=#57f0fb>Stat bonuses</color> for all commandants.
62008142	Celica	A certain amount of Trial Prototypes will be produced in <color=#57f0fb>Phase Results</color>. This amount <color=#57f0fb>will increase over time</color>.
62008151	Celica	As you clear the Dark blocks of the four areas, tokens will be produced at a higher <color=#57f0fb>rate</color>.
62009156	Celica	Now is the time for <color=#57f0fb>Repeated Simulation</color>. You can still use Computing Power to take part in the battle, but no block Contribution will be earned.
62009159	Celica	In Repeated Simulations, you will earn <color=#57f0fb>a fixed amount of</color> Trial Prototypes at the end of battle.
62031136	Celica	Welcome to <color=#57f0fb>Infinity Algorithm</color>. Here, characters will receive a variety of <color=#57f0fb>Effect</color> boosts that help overcome the challenges ahead.
62031167	Celica	There are two chapters in this event, which will be unlocked over time. Let's enter Chapter <color=#57f0fb>Ultima Slash</color> - Soul Disintegration first.
62031170	Celica	Only specified characters can be deployed in this chapter, each granted the <color=#57f0fb>Ultima Slash</color> buff. The buff effects will be unlocked as you progress through the stages.
62031176	Celica	You can tap a character portrait or the buff icon to view the <color=#57f0fb>buff effect details</color>.
52803058	Celica	There are various environments in the <color=#57f0fb>Entropic Distortion</color> zone, where you can select any of the available Environment Affixes to start the challenge.
52803108	Celica	The <color=#57f0fb>Entropic Distortion</color> zone is now unlocked.
52803112	Celica	The <color=#57f0fb>Full-Realm Support</color> that frames receive is effective under all Environment Affixes in the current zone.
52803117	Celica	Your operation points in this zone are determined by <color=#57f0fb>the highest points</color> achieved under these Environment Affixes. Please plan your operation wisely by deploying suitable frames.
62025185	Celica	The time grids that exceed the current schedule plan will not be cleared. The <color=#57f0fb>remaining time</color> will stay after being moved, which you can use for other schedule plans.
62026185	Celica	The <color=#57f0fb>time grids selected</color> before Art Edification will be extended by 1 time unit.
62026202	Celica	Art edification can be a great way to help one sleep peacefully.
62027185	Celica	Having a decent campsite is the first step to guaranteeing good sleep quality outdoors.
62027186	Celica	Once Noise-Cancelling Construction is triggered, <color=#57f0fb>all</color> of Wanshi's sleep plans will be <color=#57f0fb>shortened by 2 time units</color>.
62028185	Celica	Fatigue poses a significant hindrance to achieving good sleep quality.
62028186	Celica	The <color=#57f0fb>time grids selected</color> before Support Request will be shortened by 1 time unit.
62029167	Celica	After <color=#57f0fb>resetting</color> or clearing a stage, you can tap here to enter Celica's Class and view tips.

63003229	Rosetta	Guide system malfunction... Restoring...
63002165	Rosetta	Welcome to New Sophiasburgh, where a brand-new journey awaits. Hope you are ready.
63004166	Rosetta	The <color=#57f0fb>battle target</color> of this region is displayed here.
63004169	Rosetta	You must meet the <color=#57f0fb>Development Level required</color> before challenging the battle target.
63004170	Rosetta	The challenge has a time limit. You must complete it <color=#57f0fb>within the designated number of days</color>.
63004177	Rosetta	The timeline also displays the remaining days.
63004181	Rosetta	At the end of every day, all three resources will be reset to 0 and converted into <color=#57f0fb>Development Level</color>.
63004183	Rosetta	<color=#57f0fb>You can take three actions every day</color>. Once your Action Points reach 0, you must rest. After resting, the time will advance to <color=#57f0fb>the next day, and Action Points will be fully restored</color>.
63004193	Rosetta	You have used all Action Points for today. Tap to rest.
63004195	Rosetta	...Hmm, this helps us understand the strength difference between us and the enemy.
63004211	Rosetta	Otherwise, the Garrison Point will <color=#57f0fb>lose Defense Points continuously</color>. Once the Defense Points drop to 0, the mission will fail.
63004213	Rosetta	You can also view the battle target on the map.
63007170	Rosetta	The Development Level equals the sum of the Development Rate of all three colors.
63007181	Rosetta	Colored resources will be reset after daily results are calculated.
63007193	Rosetta	During rest, colored resources are multiplied by their corresponding multipliers and added to the Development Rate of the color. The daily <color=#57f0fb>growth</color> of Development Rate is shown here.
63007195	Rosetta	Note that color multipliers will not be reset. Recruit more members to increase the color multipliers.
63006166	Rosetta	Use Registration Forms to recruit combat members.
63006169	Rosetta	Combat members provide different levels of <color=#57f0fb>color multipliers</color>.
63006170	Rosetta	At the end of every day, color multipliers will be <color=#57f0fb>multiplied</color> to colored resources, contributing to their respective Development Rate.
63006177	Rosetta	Once chosen, color multipliers will <color=#57f0fb>stack permanently</color>, so make your choice carefully.
63006181	Rosetta	Select any combat member to recruit.

63051177	Teddy	If there is an open space below that is at least the length of the square, the square will <color=#57f0fb>automatically fall down</color>. If the square <color=#57f0fb>fills up</color> the entire row, it will be automatically cleared, granting you points.
63051179	Teddy	After every turn, all cubes will <color=#57f0fb>move upward</color>. You can check the <color=#57f0fb>preview</color> of the upcoming row layout here.

63103176	Yata	The grids that need protection will have <color=#57f0fb>special indicators</color>.
63103177	Yata	Some supplies are very fragile and require <color=#57f0fb>Paddings</color> to protect their <color=#57f0fb>fragile parts</color>.
63103179	Yata	<color=#57f0fb>Put Paddings</color> in the protection grids to ensure the supply is collected intact. Unprotected supplies <color=#57f0fb>will not yield Achievement Points</color>.
63104176	Yata	Placing <color=#57f0fb>two</color> supplies of the same color increases the Achievement Points earned from this color by 50%. If there are <color=#57f0fb>three or more</color> supplies of the same color, the Achievement Points of this color are increased by 75%.
63104177	Yata	Collecting supplies <color=#57f0fb>of the same color</color> grants extra Achievement Points.
63111167	Celica	Welcome to <color=#57f0fb>Surviving Samsara</color>, Commandant.
63111171	Celica	In each chapter, you will need to use a single team to <color=#57f0fb>challenge three enemies consecutively</color>, with each enemy having a unique affix.
63111195	Celica	This challenge consists of 3 chapters. In each chapter, you will need to use a single team to <color=#57f0fb>challenge three enemies consecutively</color>. Let's start with the first chapter.
63111196	Celica	Before starting, you need to select a <color=#57f0fb>Chapter Weakness</color> to design your combat strategy around it.
63111201	Celica	Once chosen, the weakness <color=#57f0fb>cannot be changed</color> during the challenge. Let's go.
63111205	Celica	All affixes will <color=#57f0fb>carry over to subsequent battles</color>. Tap here to view them.
63112201	Celica	After defeating the enemy, you must assign a character to <color=#57f0fb>station</color>. Stationed characters <color=#57f0fb>cannot participate in subsequent battles</color> but will provide a powerful <color=#57f0fb>bonus</color>.
63114201	Celica	In this chapter, you can choose <color=#57f0fb>any three</color> of the six enemies to challenge.
63114202	Celica	Each battle has <color=#57f0fb>independent difficulty levels</color>. You may choose any difficulty to challenge.
63114204	Celica	Each enemy has 4 difficulty levels. You must <color=#57f0fb>clear or auto-clear</color> a difficulty level to unlock the next one.
63114206	Celica	Each difficulty level has corresponding <color=#57f0fb>points</color> and <color=#57f0fb>bonus affixes</color>. Choose wisely to earn a higher score.
63113201	Celica	<color=#57f0fb>Boss enemies</color> have a <color=#57f0fb>special ability</color> that they <color=#57f0fb>will use to enhance other enemies</color> in subsequent battles.
63115167	Celica	After <color=#57f0fb>completing a chapter</color>, you can claim great mission rewards.
63121136	Yata	Welcome to <color=#57f0fb>Hydrangea Gala</color>, Commandant.
63121161	Yata	This event consists of <color=#57f0fb>2 chapters: Blossom Seer and Sunset Visit</color>, which unlock at different times. Select the <color=#57f0fb>Blossom Seer</color> chapter now.
63122136	Yata	Where should we start...? First, let's go over the basics of block placement.
63122220	Yata	Select the first block.
63122221	Yata	<color=#57f0fb>Drag and drop</color> the Red Arcade Machine to the highlighted area.
63122222	Yata	Tap confirm to complete.
63122223	Yata	Blocks of the same color will connect and form a larger block.
63122224	Yata	Tap <color=#57f0fb>Score Mode</color> to view the current score.
63122226	Yata	Look at the current visitor flow pattern... Looks like they won't pass through the area we set up at all.
63122227	Yata	In this case, we need to play some tricks.
63122228	Yata	First, put the Red Arcade Machine here.
63122229	Yata	Next, rotate it to block the path.
63122230	Yata	Tap to confirm. Done!
63122233	Commandant	That was a bit crude... Speaking of which, I noticed a special vendor here.
63122235	Yata	This is the Oden Store, selling Misono High's unique snacks. If it were me, I might <color=#57f0fb>take a detour just to grab a bite there</color>.
63122237	Commandant	I'll place it in the festival area too.
63122240	Commandant	If I put it here, it might block the visitors' path...
63122242	Commandant	Tap the previously placed Arcade Machine to reposition it to avoid blocking the path.
63122245	Commandant	Let's put it here instead.
63122250	Yata	If someone wants to eat Oden, they'll have to take a detour, right? ...You are a business genius.
63122259	Yata	If a character's favorite special block is present, they will prioritize going there.
63122261	Yata	As the character heads to <color=#57f0fb>their favorite special block, all the blocks they pass on the way will grant special points again</color>.
63122263	Yata	Let the festival begin once you are ready.
63122275	Yata	The festival visitors will start from here.
63122277	Yata	Now, visitors will pass the blocks we have placed.
63122283	Commandant	Place special blocks next.
63123136	Yata	It seems the visitors have not noticed the room above.
63123223	Yata	Continue placing blocks to aim for a higher score!
63123282	Yata	Tap a game block.
63123284	Yata	Select the Blue Arcade Machine.
63123286	Yata	Place the blocks strategically <color=#57f0fb>to change the visitor's routes</color> and achieve a higher festival score.
63124136	Yata	What a crowded room. I don't think the visitors would want to go in.
63124223	Yata	Confirm placement.
63124284	Yata	Select a <color=#57f0fb>special block</color> to the character's liking.
63124286	Yata	Place it in the right location.
63124290	Yata	If a character's favorite <color=#57f0fb>special block</color> is present, they will <color=#57f0fb>prioritize going there even if they have to take a detour</color>.
63124292	Yata	As the character heads to <color=#57f0fb>the special block, all the blocks they pass on the way will grant special points again</color>.
63124294	Yata	Different characters prefer different special blocks. <color=#57f0fb>When they go through their preferred special blocks, exclusive stories will be unlocked</color>.
63124296	Yata	Now that visitors have been attracted to the special block, place the remaining blocks to increase your festival score!
63125136	Yata	There will be a performance on the <color=#57f0fb>stage</color>.
63125290	Yata	Once the stage is placed, it becomes the new <color=#57f0fb>ending point</color>.
63126136	Yata	Tap the Flower block.
63126284	Yata	The <color=#57f0fb>special rules</color> of blocks can be viewed here.
63126286	Yata	Let's aim for a higher score—wait, did that statue just move?
63126299	Yata	"I remember hearing similar stories in Misono High —""The Seven Misono Mysteries""."
63126301	Yata	If a statue is surrounded by many students, it would suddenly move on its own... something along the lines of that.
63126303	Yata	Mystery and the festival together... that sounds like a great attraction.
63126305	Yata	"It is said that if a <color=#57f0fb>""Mystery"" block is adjacent to a block of 10 or above, once the character passes through the Mystery block</color>, something amazing will happen."
63127136	Yata	Different festival venues have different scoring rules.
63127161	Yata	Follow the rules and aim for an even higher score!
63127185	Yata	In addition, different characters also have different preferred special blocks. <color=#57f0fb>Completing the festival with a character will unlock their exclusive stories.</color>.
63116167	Celica	In the <color=#57f0fb>first two battles</color> of Chapter 3, you can use <color=#57f0fb>Auto Clear</color> after meeting the specific conditions.
63116168	Celica	To <color=#57f0fb>activate Auto Clear</color>, the following conditions must be satisfied: \nClear <color=#57f0fb>the selected enemy for the first time</color>;\nReach a <color=#57f0fb>specific total score under the corresponding difficulty</color>.
63116170	Celica	Once all conditions are satisfied, tap <color=#57f0fb>Auto Clear</color> to automatically clear the current stage.
63128181	Yata	Let's take a look at the festival venue first.
63200005	Nanami	Welcome to <color=#57f0fb>Stellar Witching Hour</color>. This time, you will join Nanami to simulate different possible futures. Let's try a simulation first.
63200067	Nanami	In different futures, you will receive <color=#57f0fb>different Add-ons</color>. These Add-ons will change how characters are used, assisting you in simulations.
63200068	Nanami	Let's roll, Commandant!
63201005	Nanami	After clearing a Dimension Domain, <color=#57f0fb>the dropped Add-ons</color> must be <color=#57f0fb>equipped</color> to characters to take effect. Let's try equipping an Add-on.
63201118	Nanami	Tap here to equip a character with an Add-on.
63201125	Nanami	<color=#57f0fb>Tap</color> an Add-on from the list to equip it.
63201131	Nanami	To <color=#57f0fb>unequip</color> an Add-on, you must select the currently equipped Add-on first.
63201133	Nanami	Then tap <color=#57f0fb>Unequip</color>.
63201135	Nanami	You can also use the <color=#57f0fb>Recommended</color> feature to automatically select Add-ons and equip them.
63201138	Nanami	Bear in mind that each character has their own <color=#57f0fb>load limit</color>. Characters with no load capacity left cannot equip more Add-ons.
63201140	Nanami	The <color=#57f0fb>load</color> required to equip the Add-on is displayed here.
63201142	Nanami	Characters' <color=#57f0fb>load</color> capacity will <color=#57f0fb>increase</color> as you progress through the simulation.
63202005	Nanami	Commandant, here are some other useful features you should know.
63202134	Nanami	"Here at ""Big Eater"", you can perform Cloud Replay <color=#57f0fb>once</color> <color=#57f0fb>per day</color> to get Add-on rewards immediately."
63202135	Nanami	When <color=#57f0fb>Hyperspace energy reaches 100%</color>, you can enter a Hyperspace Singularity and obtain <color=#57f0fb>many Add-ons</color> after challenging it.
63203005	Nanami	Once you have collected a certain number of Add-ons, you can enhance them in <color=#57f0fb>Wanderer's Guide</color>.
63203134	Nanami	<color=#57f0fb>Collect the required number of Add-ons of the specific star level</color> to activate the corresponding enhancements.
63203140	Nanami	Tap here to view a summary of all <color=#57f0fb>active</color> Wanderer's Guide enhancements.
63203150	Nanami	In <color=#57f0fb>Add-on Codex</color>, you can <color=#57f0fb>purchase</color> Add-ons that may drop from the cleared stages.
63203153	Nanami	Select an Add-on.
63203156	Nanami	Use <color=#57f0fb>Simulation Crystal Flux</color> to <color=#57f0fb>unlock</color> the selected Add-on.
63203164	Nanami	Each Add-on star level has five enhancements. Tap to view details.
63204069	Nanami	Here, you can <color=#57f0fb>adjust how enhancement points</color> are allocated. All enhancements have the same limit, which increases as you progress through the simulation.
63204072	Nanami	After adjusting, tap <color=#57f0fb>Confirm & Save</color> to apply the changes.
63204074	Nanami	Tap here to save the current setup as a <color=#57f0fb>template</color>. You can quickly switch between setups by applying templates.
63204078	Nanami	Here's another way to power you up, Commandant! Use the <color=#57f0fb>Simulation Crystal Flux</color> obtained from battles to enhance <color=#57f0fb>the entire team's stats</color>!
63204084	Nanami	Each type of enhancement has a <color=#57f0fb>special stat</color> that can assist you in further exploration.
63204086	Nanami	Once the enhancement has reached <color=#57f0fb>the required level</color>, the special stat will be unlocked.
63210128	Nanami	Welcome to <color=#57f0fb>Cosmic Odyssey</color>, Commandant.
63210130	Nanami	In this event, you will need to help Nanami gather the supplies required for interstellar travel. Let's <color=#57f0fb>begin our journey</color>!
63210132	Nanami	First, let's start with the basics!
63210136	Nanami	Tap <color=#57f0fb>Start</color> to enter the first stage.
63211128	Nanami	Swipe across the board to move the <color=#57f0fb>Supply Blocks</color>. Two identical blocks can be <color=#57f0fb>merged</color> into a higher-tier block.
63211141	Nanami	Once a Supply Block reaches <color=#57f0fb>Lv.16</color>, it and all adjacent blocks in a cross pattern will be <color=#57f0fb>cleared</color>. Their <color=#57f0fb>points will be added</color> to your score.
63211145	Nanami	Try to merge as many Lv.16 blocks as possible within the limited moves!
63212128	Nanami	When multiple identical blocks appear together, <color=#57f0fb>combo merge</color> can be triggered. Let's move them into the same row first.
63212141	Nanami	Swipe horizontally now to perform a <color=#57f0fb>combo merge</color> and instantly get a Lv.16 block.
63213128	Nanami	During exploration, you may also come across <color=#57f0fb>Energy Meteorites</color>. They cannot move but will block the movement of Supply Blocks.
63213141	Nanami	But don't worry! Each time an <color=#57f0fb>Energy Meteorite</color> blocks another block's movement, it will lose 1 durability, and will shatter when its durability drops to 0.
63214128	Nanami	During your journey, various items will be unlocked to help Nanami collect supplies.
63214141	Nanami	<color=#57f0fb>Replica</color> allows you to copy the block with the highest points on the board. Use it to resolve the problem!
63214146	Nanami	When a Lv.16 block comes into contact with Energy Meteorites, it will shatter them directly and <color=#57f0fb>charge up</color> your items. Use this feature wisely.
63215128	Nanami	"When a Lv.16 block is created, it will activate adjacent <color=#57f0fb>""Cleaners""""""""</color>. Activated """"""""Cleaners"" will <color=#57f0fb>clear</color> their adjacent blocks."
63216128	Nanami	Nanami's new ability, <color=#57f0fb>Phaseshift</color>, can swap any two blocks or move a block to a designated empty space.
63217128	Nanami	<color=#57f0fb>Space Thunderstorm</color> targets high-level Supply Blocks and will reduce them to the lowest level in the next turn.
63217139	Nanami	When you see a thunderstorm warning, quickly relocate the high-level Supply Block in this grid.
63220169	Celica	To accommodate the habits of different players, Shadow Strike can be triggered in two ways. Tap this button to <color=#57f0fb>switch the skill input mode</color>.
63220172	Celica	The second method is to <color=#57f0fb>press and hold Basic Attack</color>. While casting Leaping Thrust, holding Basic Attack will automatically activate Shadow Strike.
63220174	Celica	<color=#57f0fb>During Shadow Strike, you can press and hold Basic Attack or tap it continuously to automatically ping special orbs.</color>
63220175	Celica	Still, after a motorcycle combo attack, you still need to manually ping the special orb to activate Shadow Strike.
63220179	Celica	The first method is the conventional approach, where players can <color=#57f0fb>ping special orbs</color> to enter Shadow Strike.
63220181	Celica	While casting Leaping Thrust, <color=#57f0fb>Red and Yellow Orbs are converted into special orbs. Ping the special orbs manually to activate Shadow Strike</color>.
63220183	Celica	After activating Shadow Strike, you can also press and hold Basic Attack or tap it continuously to ping special orbs.
63220185	Celica	Pressing and holding Basic Attack makes the entire process smoother. It is <color=#57f0fb>recommended for players who prefer Darkflow-related attacks</color>.
63220187	Celica	This method prevents you from accidentally pressing and holding buttons during Lightning-focused attacks, and is <color=#57f0fb>recommended for Lightning-focused play styles</color>.
63218141	Nanami	We have unlocked <color=#57f0fb>Infinite Challenge</color>. In <color=#57f0fb>Infinite Challenge</color>, there is no move limit or score goal.
63218143	Nanami	However, the difficulty increases as you take more moves, allowing you to challenge yourself and set new records.
63205005	Nanami	Commandant, you might have already noticed that 6-star Add-ons have a unique Quantum Affix system.
63205149	Nanami	Tap here to unlock the Quantum Affix.
63205150	Nanami	You can consume Simulation Crystal Flux to unlock the Quantum Affix or reset already unlocked affixes.
63206070	Nanami	You must complete all Dimension Domains to complete a simulation.
63206072	Nanami	If you fail a challenge, Nanami will save your progress, so you can continue from where you left off when you challenge again. Take care, Commandant!
63206104	Nanami	Let's enter the Dimension Domain.
63206109	Nanami	Each simulation has different Add-on <color=#57f0fb>drop rates</color>. You will also get <color=#57f0fb>First-Clear Add-on</color> after clearing some stages. I'll leave the rest to you, Commandant!
63301169	Celica	Commandant, your <color=#57f0fb>S-Rank Choice Pack</color> has been stored in the Items.
63301178	Celica	Tap Items.
63301180	Celica	Open the Item interface.
63301183	Celica	Select the S-Rank Choice Pack.
63301188	Celica	Tap on the pack to use it.
63301193	Celica	Commandant, your <color=#57f0fb>S-Rank Choice Pack</color> has been stored in the Items.
63312139	Nanami	<color=#57f0fb>Upgrade</color> your Main City now, Commandant!
63312140	Nanami	This is the <color=#57f0fb>Main City</color>. Our journey starts here!
63312141	Nanami	We can't have an empty Main City. Behold, Nanami's <color=#57f0fb>upgrading</color> magic—
63311030	Nanami	Commandant, Nanami just found a new game——<color=#57f0fb>Spice and Salt</color>! Come play it with Nanami!
63311112	Nanami	Don't worry if you don't know how to play it! Nanami will guide you through the tutorial!
63311113	Nanami	Tap here to begin.
63311114	Nanami	Each stage has a set number of <color=#57f0fb>required quarters</color>. Clear the stage and gain 1st Clear Rewards by completing the required number of quarters.
63311115	Nanami	Completing <color=#57f0fb>Challenge Goals</color> will grant one-time rewards.
63311116	Nanami	Let's begin!
63313136	Nanami	Hoho, that's more like it! Now that the <color=#57f0fb>Main City is upgraded</color>, there are blocks that <color=#57f0fb>we can explore</color>!
63313148	Nanami	By the way, you should have also noticed that there are <color=#57f0fb>areas we can purchase</color>. We should purchase it ASAP!
63313149	Nanami	Unfortunately, we don't have enough Golden Shells yet. Let's see if we can find anything nice from exploration! <color=#57f0fb>Exploring has no cost</color>.
63314136	Nanami	Oops, still not enough Golden Shells. Let's check out <color=#57f0fb>Quarter Planning</color> then!
63314152	Nanami	The <color=#57f0fb>Productivity</color> is shown here. You can allocate it to produce <color=#57f0fb>three types of goods</color>. Nanami suggests producing a bit of <color=#57f0fb>each type of good</color>!
63314154	Nanami	Well, we only have 1 Productivity anyway. Let's produce <color=#57f0fb>coconuts</color>!
63314156	Nanami	Nanami has secretly increased the <color=#57f0fb>price</color> of coconuts!
63314158	Nanami	After allocating Productivity, you can see the <color=#57f0fb>estimated income</color>.
63314160	Nanami	The <color=#57f0fb>total income</color> is displayed here.
63314162	Nanami	Speaking of which, we just got some coconuts from our exploration. Let's <color=#57f0fb>sell</color> them now!
63314164	Nanami	<color=#57f0fb>Sell</color> all of them!
63314166	Nanami	Now we should have enough Golden Shells. Let's take a break!
63315136	Nanami	Come on, Commandant! We can purchase a <color=#57f0fb>new area</color>!
63315148	Nanami	This area contains a <color=#57f0fb>city</color>. Once you purchase it, you can gain its bonus!
63315149	Nanami	Here are more blocks we can explore. Let's check out the <color=#57f0fb>city missions</color> first!
63315154	Nanami	Coco-nice! The price of <color=#57f0fb>coconuts</color> has increased!
63315156	Nanami	Cities will also issue <color=#57f0fb>city missions</color>. Complete them to further increase the city bonuses!
63316136	Nanami	Commandant, have you noticed this? You can get <color=#57f0fb>Merchant EXP</color> from <color=#57f0fb>buying areas</color> and <color=#57f0fb>upgrading cities</color>!
63316148	Nanami	<color=#57f0fb>Upgrade the Main City</color> to get more Productivity and unlock new areas to purchase! This is important, don't forget!
63317136	Changyu	Commandant, we can <color=#57f0fb>construct buildings</color> now.
63317159	Changyu	To construct a building, we need a <color=#57f0fb>block</color>, a <color=#57f0fb>Building Blueprint</color>, and Golden Shells. This is a block we can build upon. Don't miss out on such blocks during exploration.
63317160	Changyu	<color=#57f0fb>Building Blueprints</color> are mainly obtained through <color=#57f0fb>upgrading the Main City</color>. As for the Golden Shells... they're on me this time!
63317162	Changyu	Once constructed, Buildings can provide you with continuous benefits. Let's build it now!

53300065	Celica	<color=#57f0fb>Mindscape Pact</color> consists of two components that provide characters with <color=#57f0fb>permanent bonuses</color>.
53300069	Celica	<color=#57f0fb>Border Pact</color> can permanently increase characters' <color=#57f0fb>skill levels</color>.
53300071	Celica	<color=#57f0fb>Sequence Pact</color> can permanently increase characters' <color=#57f0fb>Extra DMG Bonus</color>.
53300076	Celica	Commandant, please attack and occupy Port Kyaranta.
53300079	Celica	After occupying a stronghold, station a character in it to receive the corresponding bonus.
53301020	Celica	This area has been occupied by enemy forces. You can choose <color=#57f0fb>Stationing</color>.
53301028	Celica	<color=#57f0fb>A team member to be stationed</color> needs to meet the following requirements.
53301037	Celica	After assigning stationed members, <color=#57f0fb>Stationing Effects</color> will be triggered.
53301044	Celica	Tap here to select or switch the stationing members.
50902047	Celica	<color=#57f0fb>Check Research</color> is available.
50902055	Celica	You may check an <color=#57f0fb>S-Rank character</color>.
50902058	Celica	After completing the check, you have a <color=#57f0fb>100%</color> chance to obtain the checked character when you get an S-Rank character, and the character is <color=#57f0fb>guaranteed within 40 Research attempts</color>.
50902096	Celica	Check Research only works for <color=#57f0fb>1</color> character, so make your choice carefully.
63318165	Changyu	Commandant, the Coconut Workshop you built has produced additional <color=#57f0fb>coconuts</color>. Tap here to claim them.
63318166	Changyu	Don't forget to claim the additional production from the Coconut Workshop every round! Other buildings have their functions too, so keep making them whenever you see <color=#57f0fb>blocks that you can construct buildings upon</color>.
63319165	Changyu	Here's another secret tip to help you make more Golden Shells, Commandant.
63319170	Changyu	Factors like production efficiency, selling price, and fluctuation will impact your <color=#57f0fb>Item Rating</color>.
63319171	Changyu	If you don't have a production plan yet, I suggest you check the current <color=#57f0fb>Item Rating</color> for ideas.
63320165	Changyu	Commandant, we have unlocked additional <color=#57f0fb>Productivity</color> after upgrading the Main City.
63320171	Changyu	You may have already discovered that the <color=#57f0fb>production quantity</color> bonus provided by every point of <color=#57f0fb>Productivity</color> differs, even for <color=#57f0fb>the same item</color>.
63320173	Changyu	Generally speaking, when you first allocate <color=#57f0fb>Productivity</color> for an item, it will generate higher revenue than when you invest Productivity in this item again later.
63320175	Changyu	If you are having trouble deciding the Productivity allocation, you may seek suggestions from the <color=#57f0fb>estimated total income</color>!
63320178	Changyu	Therefore, I suggest you experiment with different combinations and expand your product range.
63321165	Changyu	Commandant, you had a <color=#57f0fb>Critical Sale</color> in the last transaction!
63321171	Changyu	What's a critical sale? Both production and sales have a chance to be <color=#57f0fb>critical</color>. When a critical is triggered, you will receive lots of bonus benefits based on the corresponding <color=#57f0fb>critical effect</color>.
63321173	Changyu	When your other attributes already have bonuses, a high <color=#57f0fb>Critical</color> will bring you remarkable benefits. Remember to keep boosting your attributes!
63322165	Changyu	Here's the <color=#57f0fb>Item Rating</color> of this collectible. The higher the Item Rating, the higher the bonuses it provides to this item!
63333122	Leonie	Time is of the essence. Select a stage to start this operation!
63401125	Celica	Welcome to <color=#57f0fb>Corrupted Battlefront - Pioneers of Peril</color>. In this event, you need to utilize the characters' new abilities to complete the challenges.

63401127	Celica	Let's start with a <color=#57f0fb>tutorial stage</color>, Commandant.
63401144	Celica	Tap here to enter Battle Preparations and select the <color=#57f0fb>Armament and Core</color> to bring into the operation.
63401146	Celica	Before starting a challenge, adjust the Core and Armament to maximize your combat efficiency.
63402125	Celica	Babylonia will give out some magazines <color=#57f0fb>every day</color>. Use them to increase your character's BP.
63402147	Celica	Let's go into action now, Commandant.
63411122	Lilith	Welcome to Loprados. This is our latest game, <color=#57f0fb>Constellation of Chess</color>, a battle of luck and wits.
63411124	Lilith	Will Lady Luck smile upon you? I'll explain the game rules now.
63411126	Lilith	Let's start with some warm-up exercises. First, select <color=#57f0fb>Opening - Tutorial I</color>.
63411130	Lilith	Here are the <color=#57f0fb>Starting Pieces</color> of this game.
63411132	Lilith	The <color=#57f0fb>number of challenge missions and stage objectives</color> of this game are shown here.
63411134	Lilith	Tap <color=#57f0fb>Start</color> to test your luck.
63412122	Lilith	The rules are easy: <color=#57f0fb>Choose</color> the <color=#57f0fb>pieces</color> to be placed on the board and <color=#57f0fb>earn high scores</color> to complete the challenge missions.
63412124	Lilith	This is the board. <color=#57f0fb>Only pieces that appear on the board will be counted toward the current round's score</color>.
63412132	Lilith	The <color=#57f0fb>base score</color> of a piece is shown in the top-left corner. Each time you finish setting the board, the piece's base score will be counted toward the game score.
63412133	Lilith	Tap a chess piece to view <color=#57f0fb>its details</color>.
63412136	Lilith	Here is your <color=#57f0fb>game score</color>. The score you have earned after setting the board each time will be <color=#57f0fb>added up together and displayed here</color>.
63412137	Lilith	Here is your challenge mission. <color=#57f0fb>After setting the board in Round 2, the game score must be at least 15</color>. Otherwise, the challenge will fail.
63412140	Lilith	You can get 1 Refresh Token after completing the challenge.
63413122	Lilith	Before the start of each round, you have <color=#57f0fb>1 chance to replenish pieces</color>. Note that you can only choose 1 from the 3 pieces provided.
63413137	Lilith	Let's choose <color=#57f0fb>[A-Rank CUB] as it has a higher base score</color> and gives us higher scores in every round.
63413141	Lilith	After replenishing a new piece, <color=#57f0fb>the game rounds +1</color>.
63413143	Lilith	Tap <color=#57f0fb>[Reset]</color> to reset the board and calculate the score.
63413167	Lilith	After setting the board, <color=#57f0fb>the base scores of pieces on the board will be counted toward your current score</color>.
63414122	Lilith	Let's check out the special effects of different pieces.
63414124	Lilith	When choosing pieces, we can view <color=#57f0fb>the pieces already in your inventory</color>. Tap on the inventory to open it.
63414138	Lilith	Select Gold to view its details.
63414140	Lilith	This is the <color=#57f0fb>score you will earn after Gold is dissolved</color>. If <color=#57f0fb>Gold is dissolved</color>, we can <color=#57f0fb>earn 2 points</color>.
63414142	Lilith	<color=#57f0fb>In each round, a Gold piece has a chance to summon another Gold</color> to the board. <color=#57f0fb>We must dissolve them quickly before they occupy the entire board</color>.
63414144	Lilith	Tap Back now. Let's see if we have a <color=#57f0fb>piece that can dissolve Gold</color>.
63414148	Lilith	Sophia is able to <color=#57f0fb>dissolve the Gold adjacent to her</color>. <color=#57f0fb>The entire circle</color> around Sophia is considered to be <color=#57f0fb>adjacent</color> to her.
63414158	Lilith	Tap <color=#57f0fb>Set Board</color>.
63414175	Lilith	Sophia has just <color=#57f0fb>earned a lot of points from dissolving Gold pieces</color>. Changyu is able to summon Gold pieces to the board. Let's choose him <color=#57f0fb>to replenish more Gold for Sophia to dissolve</color>.
63414178	Lilith	Select Sophia.
63415122	Lilith	Each piece has <color=#57f0fb>1-3 tags</color>. Pieces with <color=#57f0fb>the same tag</color> have <color=#57f0fb>skills that will interact with each other</color>.
63415133	Lilith	The <color=#57f0fb>quantity of pieces</color> under a particular tag is shown here. Generally, we should choose the <color=#57f0fb>tag with the most pieces</color> as the main type.
63415135	Lilith	We need to choose <color=#57f0fb>pieces with the corresponding tag</color>. You can also <color=#57f0fb>change your main type by adjusting the number of pieces</color>.
63415137	Lilith	Before replenishing, don't forget to check <color=#57f0fb>the pieces in your inventory</color>. Pay attention to how their skills work together.
63416122	Lilith	We're already at Stage 4. This time, our starting pieces are Selena and Teddy.
63416133	Lilith	Cheat Code grants Selena and Teddy <color=#57f0fb>3 bonus points</color> during every round's score calculation.
63416137	Lilith	Cheat Code <color=#57f0fb>takes effect as long as it's inside your inventory</color>! As long as you have it, it doesn't need to be on the board to take effect!
63416140	Lilith	Tap Set Board.
63416148	Lilith	Cheat Code enabled. Selena and Teddy will <color=#57f0fb>permanently get +2 base score</color> in every round.
63416150	Lilith	This is it!
63416158	Lilith	Turn on Speed-Up to accelerate the calculation of scores.
63417122	Lilith	Here it comes! Could it be your lucky piece, Luckless Commandant? Its skill has <color=#57f0fb>a certain chance to turn you into a Lucky Commandant</color>.
63417153	Lilith	Hmm? Are you expecting something? Just pick it. It won't go wrong.
63417156	Lilith	Tap Set Board and see if you are lucky.
63417161	Lilith	You have become a <color=#57f0fb>Lucky Commandant</color>! Not bad, you can keep enjoying your luck bonus.
63418122	Lilith	The pieces have taken up the entire board! Is there something wrong with this machine? Don't you dare slam the case!
63418134	Lilith	"A new option, ""Delete Piece"", has been added! We can now <color=#57f0fb>choose to either replenish 1 piece or delete 1 piece</color>."
63418136	Lilith	Select the <color=#57f0fb>Delete Piece</color> tag.
63418161	Lilith	We can <color=#57f0fb>select any 1 piece to delete it</color>.
63418164	Lilith	I see the logo of Gray Raven! Let's see what effects this one has.
63418166	Lilith	When <color=#57f0fb>a Gray Raven member and Gray Raven's Logo are both on the board, you will earn lots of points</color>.
63418168	Lilith	There are 21 pieces in the inventory, but <color=#57f0fb>the board has only 20 slots</color>. To ensure a Gray Raven member and Gray Raven's Logo are both on the board, we need to <color=#57f0fb>delete 1 piece</color>.
63418170	Lilith	Cog has a low base score. <color=#57f0fb>Delete 1 Cog</color>.
63418173	Lilith	Tap Delete.
63418176	Lilith	Confirm deletion.
63418180	Lilith	Now we have one less piece. You can also <color=#57f0fb>use a Delete Token in the inventory to delete a piece</color>.
63418184	Lilith	1 Delete Token is required to delete a piece from the inventory. <color=#57f0fb>You can get Delete Tokens by completing in-game challenge missions</color>.
63419124	Lilith	We are getting more and more <color=#57f0fb>CUBs</color>. Buddy's skill can dissolve them.
63419126	Lilith	Select <color=#57f0fb>Buddy</color>.
63420124	Lilith	Hah, <color=#57f0fb>Celica</color> has shown up. Her skill is extremely powerful. Maybe today really is your lucky day.
63420126	Lilith	This piece doesn't appear very often! Keep exploring, Commandant.
63421124	Lilith	Shark-speare? It looks like a formidable foe, but you can easily defeat it if <color=#57f0fb>you have a combat character with a base score of 15 or above</color> on the board!
63421126	Lilith	We need to increase the combat character's base score to 15 or above. There are many weapons on the board, which we can use to <color=#57f0fb>boost the base score of combat characters</color>.
63421136	Lilith	Nice, here comes a <color=#57f0fb>combat character, Alpha</color>. Let's use her to dissolve the weapons on the board and boost her base score.
63421138	Lilith	Select Alpha.
63421140	Lilith	Next, <color=#57f0fb>select as many weapons as we can</color> to boost Alpha's base score.
63422124	Lilith	There are many <color=#57f0fb>Goofballs</color> on the board. When <color=#57f0fb>a Goofball is adjacent to Punishing Virus</color>, it can immediately be <color=#57f0fb>converted into a low-level enemy</color>.
63422133	Lilith	Did the enemies scare you? Sometimes, you can also <color=#57f0fb>use the enemy</color> to achieve desirable outcomes. I'll show you how to do so.
63422135	Lilith	<color=#57f0fb>Mother can devour low-level enemies to increase her base score</color>, so we should create low-level enemies to feed her.
63422141	Lilith	Therefore, we should select <color=#57f0fb>Punishing Virus</color> to provide Mother with more low-level enemies.
63423124	Lilith	There are too many Goofballs in the inventory. We are running out of Punishing Virus. Use <color=#57f0fb>Lazer</color> to dissolve Goofballs and earn bonus points.
63423126	Lilith	We need <color=#57f0fb>Lazer</color> to dissolve Goofballs! Select Lazer.
63442001	Celica	<color=#57f0fb>Insatiable Research</color> is now available. You can <color=#57f0fb>obtain S-Rank Amplifier Construct Lilith: Mirage for free</color>.
63442002	Celica	Select the Insatiable Research tab.

63441129	Celica	Commandant, <color=#57f0fb>Insatiable Research - Limited</color> is now available.
63403147	Celica	A new feature of <color=#57f0fb>Preparation</color> can be unlocked. Go check it out, Commandant.

63424156	Lilith	Looks like you aren't happy with the base scores of these pieces. <color=#57f0fb>Use</color> the <color=#57f0fb>Refresh Token</color> you got from challenge missions to refresh the pieces.
63424158	Lilith	Refresh completed. <color=#57f0fb>Sophia</color> has a base score of 4.
63424164	Lilith	Tap <color=#57f0fb>Set Board</color> to calculate the score of Round 3.
63424170	Lilith	Select <color=#57f0fb>Sophia</color>.

63502138	Celica	<color=#57f0fb>The opponent's expression may reveal their thoughts.</color> This opponent appears cautious and likely won't play a high-value card.
63502140	Celica	<color=#57f0fb>Drag</color> a card here to <color=#57f0fb>play</color> it.
63502142	Celica	Let's play the 4 of Hearts this turn.

63542149	Celica	Lucia: Lotus' Core Passive <color=#57f0fb>draws an additional card after a 3-Ping and doubles subsequent damage for the rest of the turn</color>.
63542153	Celica	Each card play <color=#57f0fb>costs an Action Point</color>, and your remaining Action Points are shown here. Now, go ahead and finish this match!
63543129	Celica	Besides Orb Cards, each character has a unique <color=#57f0fb>Signature Card</color>. Playing it costs an Action Point, and it cannot be played with other cards.
63543132	Celica	Now, switch targets and <color=#57f0fb>play the Signature Card to finish off the enemy</color>! Go ahead and finish this match.
63543142	Celica	3-Ping Orb Cards to activate Lucia's [Dual Blades], which can <color=#57f0fb>double the damage of the Signature Card</color>.
63544129	Celica	Non-Attacker Constructs start a match in the standby position. Swapping active characters <color=#57f0fb>costs an Action Point</color>. Now, tap on Nanami's portrait to switch her in.
63544142	Celica	Storm's Core Passive <color=#57f0fb>draws an additional card after a 3-Ping and grants you Armor. Armor absorbs incoming damage before your HP in one turn</color>.
63544163	Celica	In contrast to Core Passives, <color=#57f0fb>when standby, a character's QTE will be triggered upon a 3-Ping of the same color</color>.
63544165	Celica	Red characters' QTEs <color=#57f0fb>restore Action Points</color>, while Yellow characters' QTEs <color=#57f0fb>grant Armor and draw extra cards</color>.
63544168	Celica	Playing a Red 3-Ping now will <color=#57f0fb>trigger Storm's Core Passive as well as the red character's QTE</color>.
63544171	Celica	After triggering a QTE, you can <color=#57f0fb>directly switch this character in at no Action Point cost</color>. Now, tap Lucia to bring her into the field.
63545129	Celica	When playing a Signature Card, <color=#57f0fb>if the character is not active, they will switch in</color>. Now, play Nanami's Signature Card and end this match!
63546129	Celica	In stages with relatively more enemies, you need to<color=#57f0fb>prioritize Constructs who can deal damage to multiple enemies</color>.
63546132	Celica	First, play a Blue 3-Ping. When Liv: Eclipse is active on the field, a Blue/Yellow 3-Ping <color=#57f0fb>heals you</color>.
63546142	Celica	Liv: Eclipse's Core Passive <color=#57f0fb>deals substantial damage to multiple enemies</color> after any 3-Ping. Let's switch her in!
63546159	Celica	Play a <color=#57f0fb>3-Ping</color> again, and you'll take down the most dangerous enemy. Now, go on and wrap up this match.

63548144	Celica	Enemies with [Rigid Body] take only 1 DMG per hit. You need to play <color=#57f0fb>enough high-value cards</color> to remove the mark.
63548146	Celica	From this stage onward, you can use <color=#57f0fb>The True Measure of a Chief</color> to <color=#57f0fb>rearrange the position of any one card in your hand</color>. Now, give it a try!
63548150	Celica	<color=#57f0fb>Rearrange your cards and play a Blue 3-Ping to negate the enemy's [Rigid Body]</color>. I'll leave the match to you then, Commandant.
63549129	Celica	Press and hold the <color=#57f0fb>enemy target</color> to view the <color=#57f0fb>special marks</color> in this stage.

63700128	Vera	Welcome to <color=#57f0fb>Blade on the Waves</color>, Commandant.
63700140	Vera	In this event, you will need to help Vera gather the supplies required to traverse the high seas. Let's enter <color=#57f0fb>Mist</color>!
63700141	Vera	Let's start with the basic rules and controls.
63700142	Vera	Tap <color=#57f0fb>Start</color> to enter the first stage.
63701128	Vera	Swipe up, down, left, right, or press WASD to move the cubes.
63701141	Vera	Cubes with the same number can merge into one. Upgrade the board after combining the <color=#57f0fb>target cube - Constellation Analysis</color>.
63701143	Vera	Swipe left to move the cube. Cubes with the same number can merge into one.
63701145	Vera	Upgrading the board will retain the largest cube, remove all other cubes, and grant <color=#57f0fb>Enhanced Moves</color>. Cubes generated from Enhanced Moves have <color=#57f0fb>greater</color> numbers.
63701149	Vera	Enhanced Moves will <color=#57f0fb>reduce by 1</color> every time a numbered cube is generated. When Enhanced Moves is reduced to 0, the numbers generated by the cubes will <color=#57f0fb>reset to default</color>.
63701151	Vera	The game is over when the board is upgraded to its highest level and the Constellation Analysis of that level has been merged.
63701153	Vera	Try to merge the target cubes as quickly as possible within the limited moves!
63702128	Vera	That effect is the creation of a specific <color=#57f0fb>special cube - Compass</color>. The number there is the cooldown timer of the special cube.
63702143	Vera	Compass can <color=#57f0fb>merge with any numbered cube once</color>.
63703128	Vera	That effect is the creation of a specific <color=#57f0fb>special cube - Beacon</color>.
63703143	Vera	Merging with a Beacon can <color=#57f0fb>double the value of adjacent cubes</color>.
63704128	Vera	That effect is the creation of a specific <color=#57f0fb>special cube - Hub</color>.
63704143	Vera	When any adjacent block's value doubles due to a Beacon, <color=#57f0fb>Hub's value is also doubled</color>.
63705128	Vera	That effect is the creation of a specific <color=#57f0fb>special cube - Power Core</color>.
63705143	Vera	When a Power Core is merged or its value is doubled, <color=#57f0fb>add 1 to the number</color> below it.
63706128	Vera	That effect is the creation of a specific <color=#57f0fb>special cube - Ballast</color>.
63706143	Vera	Ballast <color=#57f0fb>cannot be moved</color>. When a Ballast cube is merged or its value is doubled, it <color=#57f0fb>becomes a Power Core</color>.
63015166	Rosetta	This time, we have a new starting effect, [Proxy Campaign], which allows you to conduct Proxy Battles at the cost of Military Development Rate.

63016172	Rosetta	The new feature <color=#57f0fb>Sand Table Reconstruction</color> allows you to rewind the operation to a few days ago and recover some resources spent during that period.
63017202	Rosetta	In specific routes of Awakening Tundra, the <color=#57f0fb>Sand Table Collapse</color> mechanic will be activated.
63017231	Rosetta	After a set number of rounds, tiles with a crash countdown will <color=#57f0fb>collapse permanently and become inaccessible</color>. Please plan your moves carefully.

63720138	Vera	Select a chapter first.
63720142	Vera	Time to battle!
63721108	Vera	The objective is to <color=#57f0fb>defeat the enemy King</color> with me. It may hide off-screen sometimes, so we need to <color=#57f0fb>force it out by defeating its minion pieces</color>!
63721138	Vera	An enemy piece has locked onto me. Let's find a way to evade it!
63721140	Vera	There are some green blocks around. They seem safe.
63721142	Vera	Tap here to <color=#57f0fb>cast a skill</color> and attack the enemy.
63721144	Vera	I can build <color=#57f0fb>Rage</color> by dealing damage, which <color=#57f0fb>enhances my skills and movement</color> after reaching a certain amount. However, note that casting enhanced skills costs Rage.
63721147	Vera	Without further ado, let's <color=#57f0fb>evade the enemy attack</color>!

63732204	Celica	Each enemy has 4 difficulty levels. You must <color=#57f0fb>clear or auto-clear</color> a difficulty level to unlock the next one.
63732206	Celica	Each difficulty level has corresponding <color=#57f0fb>points</color> and <color=#57f0fb>bonus affixes</color>. Choose wisely to earn a higher score.
63731201	Celica	After defeating the enemy, you must assign a character to <color=#57f0fb>station</color>. Stationed characters <color=#57f0fb>cannot participate in subsequent battles</color> but will provide a powerful <color=#57f0fb>bonus</color>.
63730167	Celica	Welcome to <color=#57f0fb>Armored Up</color>, Commandant.
63730171	Celica	In each chapter, you will need to use a single team to <color=#57f0fb>challenge three enemies consecutively</color>, with each enemy having a unique affix.
63730195	Celica	This challenge consists of 3 chapters. In each chapter, you will need to use a single team to <color=#57f0fb>challenge three enemies consecutively</color>. Let's start with the first chapter.
63730196	Celica	Before starting, you need to select a <color=#57f0fb>Chapter Weakness</color> to design your combat strategy around it.
63730201	Celica	Once chosen, the weakness <color=#57f0fb>cannot be changed</color> during the challenge. Let's go.
63730205	Celica	All affixes will <color=#57f0fb>carry over to subsequent battles</color>. Tap here to view them.
63730211	Celica	<color=#57f0fb>Boss enemies</color> have a <color=#57f0fb>special ability</color> that they <color=#57f0fb>will use to enhance other enemies</color> in subsequent battles.

63942136	Selena	<color=#57f0fb>When exiting Fanaticism</color> state, Shark-shark will <color=#57f0fb>bring blocks back down to two rows</color> and reset all blocks below the board.

63944192	Selena	This looks like quite the challenge, Conductor. Get ready and we'll face it together!
63944204	Selena	It's a red note block! <color=#57f0fb>Clear it to obtain measure reduction items!</color>
63945136	Selena	Sometimes blocks will <color=#57f0fb>rise two rows at once</color>, so you'll need to plan ahead, Conductor.
63945192	Selena	Let's try operating this block.
63945204	Selena	When entering Fanaticism state, <color=#57f0fb>consuming enhanced moves can enhance Item</color> effects. Try it out now!
63946136	Bianca	Commandant, this stage features a new special block called <color=#57f0fb>Legato Block</color>. Tap here and we shall read the description together.
63910009	Nirvatia	During your journey, your choices will determine how events unfold.
63910011	Nirvatia	First-time encounters will grant additional rewards, so keep an eye out for events you haven't handled before.
63911121	Nirvatia	Combat in <color=#57f0fb>The Godfall Revelation</color> is fully automatic. You'll need to equip your characters with suitable <color=#57f0fb>Skills</color> and <color=#57f0fb>Sigils</color> to face powerful enemies.
63911162	Nirvatia	After starting the mission, you'll first enter the preparation phase, where you can equip your characters with <color=#57f0fb>Skills</color> and <color=#57f0fb>Sigils</color>.
63911165	Nirvatia	Tap <color=#57f0fb>Select</color> to acquire Skills, or directly <color=#57f0fb>drag</color> Skills to skill slots.
63911169	Nirvatia	Characters can equip up to 3 <color=#57f0fb>Skills</color>.
63911184	Nirvatia	Before your first battle, you need to choose one Skill from three options.
63911186	Nirvatia	During the Skill selection phase, you must choose one Skill to proceed to the next stage.
63911188	Nirvatia	After every few battles, you can choose an additional Skill.
63912121	Nirvatia	Gray Raven, you can use <color=#57f0fb>Coins</color> to purchase Sigils from me.
63912189	Nirvatia	Initially, characters can equip 3 Sigils. You can spend Coins to unlock more slots. A maximum of 10 Sigils can be equipped simultaneously.
63912191	Nirvatia	Tap unlocked slots to unlock additional slot capacity. After each battle, slot unlock prices will <color=#57f0fb>drop</color> by 3 Coins.
63912193	Nirvatia	Tap Sigils to view their detailed descriptions.
63912196	Nirvatia	All Sigils provide basic Attack and Health stats.
63912198	Nirvatia	Sigils are divided into 4 rarity levels: <color=#4da27b>Green</color>, <color=#437cad>Blue</color>, <color=#d65fb3>Purple</color>, and <color=#ee762e>Orange</color>. The higher the rarity, the stronger the stats and effects the Sigils provide.
63912200	Nirvatia	In addition, Sigils also provide special effects that enhance Characters' efficiency in battle.
63912202	Nirvatia	In the Scorched Borderland, Sigils have been divided into different <color=#57f0fb>schools</color>.
63912205	Nirvatia	If you find Sigils you like but are short on Coins, you can also choose to <color=#57f0fb>Freeze</color> those Sigils.
63912207	Nirvatia	If there's nothing here that suits you, you can also choose to <color=#57f0fb>Refresh</color> them, and I'll find some new Sigils for you.
63912209	Nirvatia	After completing your preparations, tap <color=#57f0fb>Start Battle</color> to enter combat.
63912211	Nirvatia	Equipping Sigils can improve Character stats and grant additional Passive Skills. Smart Sigil combinations are the key to victory.

63912215	Nirvatia	Even after starting a battle, Frozen Sigils will not disappear.
63913009	Nirvatia	After winning battles, you can obtain Mammon Platinum Coins as rewards based on your performance, which can be used to exchange for Items in the Shop.
63914011	Gray Raven	The battle on the train went smoothly, but what happened after that?
63915011	Gray Raven	Did you save me, Nirvatia?
63915014	Nirvatia	Are you feeling better now?
63915016	Nirvatia	Yes, your injuries were severe. Next time... don't push yourself so hard.
63915018	Gray Raven	I've remembered some things, but they're still a bit hazy.
63915020	Nirvatia	After all, you were unconscious for a long time. Your body still needs to adjust.
63915022	Nirvatia	Take a little rest. I'll show you around this inn.
63916014	Nirvatia	Countless adventurers seeking wealth and glory roam these ashen lands. You can choose to join the Desperado Clash and test your skills against them.
63916017	Nirvatia	Alternatively, you can choose to continue staying in the inn, embark on the path of Revelation, and continue the campaign against the gods with your companions.
63917014	Nirvatia	Go talk with your companions. That might help you recover your memories better.
63918014	Nirvatia	War Watanabe—he's an excellent warrior. Embark on a journey with him and unveil the past you two share.
63918019	Nirvatia	Investigating events allows you to collect clues. Once all clues are gathered, you can begin the intelligence analysis phase.
63918022	Nirvatia	So, explore new events as much as possible and gather all the clues.

63919196	Nirvatia	After choosing an answer you're satisfied with, tap Deduce to answer the question.
63920014	Nirvatia	Welcome to <color=#57f0fb>Desperado Clash</color>, Gray Raven.

63920021	Nirvatia	Select a Character to use for this challenge.
63920022	Nirvatia	Each Character has independent Points. Participate in <color=#57f0fb>Desperado Clash</color>, defeat enemies to gain Points, and raise your <color=#57f0fb>rank</color>.
63920031	Nirvatia	There are a total of 5 ranks in Desperado Clash. Increase your rank during the event period to earn honor rewards.
63920033	Nirvatia	Let's try a challenge.
63920036	Nirvatia	Tap Action Time to find your opponent.
63920038	Nirvatia	Winning Battles improves your ranking and grants you generous rewards in the long run.
63921162	Nirvatia	After winning a Battle, you can obtain 1 <color=#57f0fb>Badge</color>. Accumulate 10 Badges to complete the challenge.
63921169	Nirvatia	Losing a battle deducts 1 <color=#57f0fb>Health</color> point. After losing 5 Health points, the challenge will end early.
63921188	Nirvatia	Ending the challenge early will still award points based on your performance in battle. So don't fear failure—glory belongs to those who dare to challenge.
63922001	Nirvatia	Gray Raven, you've gathered four knights to fight beside you. The time has come—let the angels see the banner of rebellion we raise.
64000001	Celica	Bianca: Crepuscule features dual forms.
64000002	Celica	You can configure her starting form as needed.
64010001	Celica	<color=#57f0fb>Threading Arts</color> is now open for business! Let's help Discord complete tailoring commissions! We'll start with <color=#57f0fb>Thorough Conception</color>.
64010002	Celica	Let's begin with Liv's Commission 1.
64011001	Celica	Tap to select a thread ball. Tap again, or tap on an empty space, to cancel the selection.
64011002	Celica	After selecting a <color=#57f0fb>thread ball</color>, you can tap adjacent ones in a cross shape to select continuously. You can also <color=#57f0fb>hold and swipe</color> to select continuously.
64011003	Celica	Thread balls of different colors have <color=#57f0fb>different values</color>. Once they enter the basket, you gain the corresponding points.
64011004	Celica	Tap here to <color=#57f0fb>reset the stage</color>.
64011005	Celica	Tap here to get <color=#57f0fb>hints</color>.
64011006	Celica	<color=#57f0fb>Hold and swipe</color> to select 4 thread balls.
64011007	Celica	You've gathered <color=#57f0fb>4 thread balls</color>, exactly the <color=#57f0fb>capacity of the basket</color>.
64011008	Celica	Connect all thread balls to the basket to complete the commission.
64012001	Celica	<color=#57f0fb>Textile dyes</color> can dye ordinary thread balls into their colors.
64012002	Celica	Put the purple textile dye into the basket.
64012003	Celica	Here you can see the <color=#57f0fb>number of uses</color> left for the dye.
64012004	Celica	Here you can see the <color=#57f0fb>basket's capacity</color>.
64012005	Celica	Tap the <color=#57f0fb>textile dye</color> at the finish point and <color=#57f0fb>drag</color> in a direction to fire the dye.
64012006	Celica	Tap the brush and fire to the left to dye the blue thread balls. Once dyed, their <color=#57f0fb>value increases</color>.
64013001	Celica	First, put the purple textile dye into the basket.
64013002	Celica	Now fire the dye to the right to color more purple thread balls and gain more points.
64014001	Celica	First, put the red raw cotton spool thread into the basket.
64014002	Celica	Drag the raw cotton spool thread at the finish point to the right to <color=#57f0fb>fill all empty spaces</color> in that direction with red thread balls.
64015001	Celica	First, put the purple bloom dye into the basket.
64015002	Celica	Drag the bloom dye at the finish point to the right to dye <color=#57f0fb>all thread balls</color> in that direction and their connected same-colored ones.
64016001	Celica	Gray thread balls <color=#57f0fb>cannot be dyed</color>.
64016002	Celica	<color=#57f0fb>Textile dyes</color> can <color=#57f0fb>dye at a distance</color>, but gray thread balls will <color=#57f0fb>block</color> the firing path.
64016003	Celica	The key is to <color=#57f0fb>move the gray thread balls</color> out of the way to clear a path for firing.
64017001	Celica	Only thread balls that are <color=#57f0fb>the same color and adjacent</color> can be dyed together.
64017002	Celica	These 3 thread balls here are <color=#57f0fb>isolated.
64017003	Celica	Move them to make them <color=#57f0fb>adjacent to the thread balls on the left</color> so you can dye more purple ones at once.
64018001	Celica	This <color=#57f0fb>textile dye</color> can be used for <color=#57f0fb>2 dyeing actions</color>.
64020001	Celica	Commandant, welcome to <color=#57f0fb>Wishing Upon a Star</color>. How do you want to spend our time together?

64021002	Celica	<color=#57f0fb>The opponent's reactions can reveal their card play.</color> A frown usually means they played a low card.
64021003	Celica	<color=#57f0fb>Drag</color> a card here to <color=#57f0fb>play</color> it.
64021004	Celica	Play the 3 of Hearts in response.

64102004	Celica	In new chapters, Veronica with unlocked abilities can interact differently with the Rattan Ball or other units.
64102005	Celica	This is your destination, which is closed now. You can pass through it before it opens.
64102006	Celica	The Kuroro with a mark is the <color=#57f0fb>key</color> to clearing the stage. Once you hit it, it will be destroyed and your destination will open.
64102007	Celica	If you're stuck, call me for a hint!
64103001	Celica	In this chapter, Veronica has <color=#57f0fb>Physical and Fire</color> types. She starts as <color=#57f0fb>Physical</color> but can switch using <color=#57f0fb>Type Switch</color> in the stage.

64112006	Celica	You can also use the <color=#57f0fb>Recommended</color> feature to automatically select Add-ons and equip them.
64112007	Celica	Bear in mind that each character has their own <color=#57f0fb>load limit</color>. Characters with no load capacity left cannot equip more Add-ons.
64112008	Celica	The <color=#57f0fb>load</color> required to equip the Add-on is displayed here.
64112009	Celica	Characters' <color=#57f0fb>load</color> capacity will <color=#57f0fb>increase</color> as you complete more battles.

64114005	Celica	<color=#57f0fb>Collect the required number of Add-ons of the specific star level</color> to activate the corresponding enhancements.

64115002	Celica	Here, you can <color=#57f0fb>adjust how enhancement points</color> are allocated. All enhancements have the same limit, which increases as you progress through the competition.
64115003	Celica	After adjusting, tap <color=#57f0fb>Confirm & Save</color> to apply the changes.
64115004	Celica	Tap here to save the current setup as a <color=#57f0fb>template</color>. You can quickly switch between setups by applying templates.
64115005	Celica	Each type of enhancement has a <color=#57f0fb>special stat</color> that can assist you in further exploration.
64115006	Celica	Once the enhancement has reached <color=#57f0fb>the required level</color>, the special stat will be unlocked.
64116001	Celica	Commandant, you might have already noticed that 6-star Add-ons have a unique Quantum Affix system. They start with 2 unlocked Quantum Affixes by default.

64121001	Celica	Welcome to <color=#57f0fb>Cat Grab</color>, Commandant. Ship modification capabilities are greatly boosted during this event. Let's get started!
64121002	Celica	Ships can undergo <color=#57f0fb>Structural Modifications</color>, granting powerful abilities. These new structures can also be expanded and upgraded.

64123001	Celica	Selecting Structural Modifications again lets you <color=#57f0fb>upgrade Structural Modifications already selected</color>, boosting their effects.
64123002	Celica	You can also <color=#57f0fb>select new Structural Modifications</color>. <color=#57f0fb>Multiple Structural Modifications can be active at the same time</color>.
64123003	Celica	Here you can view <color=#57f0fb>selected Structural and General Modifications</color>. Tap here to <color=#57f0fb>view modification details</color>.

64200001	Liv	Welcome to <color=#57f0fb>Fluffy Snooze</color>, Commandant.
64200002	Liv	In this event, you will enter Liv's dream to help guide the lost sheep back to their pens and ease her stress. Let's begin by entering the <color=#57f0fb>Light Sleep</color> phase.
64200003	Liv	Let's start with the basic rules and controls.
64200004	Liv	Tap <color=#57f0fb>Start</color> to enter the first stage.
64201001	Liv	Swipe up, down, left, or right, or use the WASD keys to move the blocks. When two blocks with the same number meet, they will merge into one.
64201002	Liv	Merge <color=#57f0fb>Bubble Blocks</color> to create the <color=#57f0fb>Target Block - Dormant Wavelength</color> and upgrade the board.
64201003	Liv	Merge <color=#57f0fb>Bubble Blocks</color> to create the <color=#57f0fb>Target Block - Dormant Wavelength</color> and upgrade the board.
64201004	Liv	Upgrading triggers a <color=#57f0fb>clearing effect</color>. The <color=#57f0fb>arrow directions on the Bubble Blocks</color> decide which areas will be cleared.
64201005	Liv	After the upgrade, the <color=#57f0fb>Bubble Blocks remain</color>.
64201006	Liv	Blocks with values less than 4 will turn into <color=#57f0fb>Clump Blocks</color>. These can only be cleared by colliding other blocks into them.
64201007	Liv	Swipe down to move the blocks and trigger a merge.
64201008	Liv	After the upgrade and clear, you will get boosted moves. During this boost, blocks with <color=#57f0fb>higher values</color> will appear. Each time a new block is generated, your <color=#57f0fb>boosted move count</color> goes down by one.
64201009	Liv	After an upgrade, the <color=#57f0fb>arrows on the Bubble Blocks</color> will refresh and point in new directions.
64201010	Liv	The game ends when you reach the highest Dream Level and successfully create the Dormant Wavelength block for that level.
64201011	Liv	Try to merge the target blocks as quickly as possible within the limited moves!
64202001	Liv	This effect creates a <color=#57f0fb>special block called a Star Block</color>. The number shown indicates how many moves are left before the block appears.
64202002	Liv	Star Blocks can <color=#57f0fb>merge once with any numbered block, except Bubble Blocks</color>.
