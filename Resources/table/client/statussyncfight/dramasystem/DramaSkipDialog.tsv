Drama_1001_001	Fragmented visions flash through your mind. A message from Lucia comes through—and that's when it hits you that the two of you have made plans to watch the Froggie movie together today.
Drama_1001_002	You must have forgotten some things because of how swamped you've been with missions lately. Free time is precious. What better way is there to spend watching a movie with Lucia?
Drama_1001_003	The staff explains how the Immersion Projector works. While the experience might differ slightly from how things happen in the original film, the opportunity to step into the movie world firsthand is still a rare pleasure.
Drama_1001_004	The dream-like scenes from the movie linger in your mind. At Lucia's suggestion, the two of you head to the nearby Kowloong Restaurant to rest and clear your heads.
Drama_1001_005	A strange voice echoes in your mind and announces the number of people in line before the server does. The wait is too long, so you and Lucia decide to sit and wait for a while at Kuroro Coffee next door.
Drama_1001_006	The voice appears again, this time precisely explaining why the barista's latte art failed. What on earth is happening?
Drama_1001_007	Lucia notices you're not feeling well and suggests you head back to the rest area early to get some rest.
Drama_1001_008	It's the same weird dream again, except you're seeing things more clearly this time. When you wake up, you see you've received a message from Lucia—identical to the one from yesterday, word for word.
Drama_1001_009	Everything seems to have reset, but the number of paper-folded clovers has gone from one to two.
Drama_1001_010	Just like Froggie in the story, you're caught in a time loop. You figured that you'd probably need to fulfill Lucia's wish to break free of the loop, based on the movie's plot.

Drama_1001_020	"The World Government Association of Art's ""Dreamweaver"" perfectly meets your needs. After some negotiation, Lucia and you secure priority access to the device. The two of you head back to the lounge to use it."
Drama_1001_021	"The keywords used dictate the shaping of the dream space. ""Hillside covered in pink blossoms,"" ""beach and ocean,"" ""fireworks""—these are the elements of the magical place Lucia and you want to create."
Drama_1001_022	"""Are you ready?"" Let's step right into this ideal dream that belongs to us."
Drama_1001_023	Everything before you meets your ideal vision perfectly—except Lucia isn't here. You know you want to go to look for her.
Drama_1001_024	Finally, the two of you meet at the seaside. You seem to recognize the person standing before you, but you're slightly unsure. She seems as familiar to you as she does unfamiliar.
Drama_1001_025	"You aren't quite sure how to preserve these beautiful moments, but you have, fortunately, been granted access to the floating camera feature in the ""Dreamweaver."" The photos taken will become a shared ""oath"" between the two of you that bears witness to all your shared wishes and memories."
Drama_1001_026	The coast, fireworks, and us. All of these have come together—after the camera's countdown freeze—to create a moment more romantic than anything else in the world.
Drama_1001_027	The two of you take a brief rest under a cherry blossom tree, where Lucia crafts a cherry blossom crown with her own hands. As a gift in return, you make her a clover ring and gently slip it onto her finger.
Drama_1001_028	The fading fireworks are a sign that your time here has come to an end. As Lucia and you walk along the shore, the two of you discuss what comes next.

Drama_1001_038	Everything else in the room remains exactly as it was yesterday morning, save for the fact that the number of the four-leaf clovers is different now. You decide to meet up with Lucia first, unsure what to make of this situation.
