1	Lucia	There you are, Commandant.	510000146	
2	Lucia	I recently learned a new folding technique that makes the clovers more three-dimensional. When you use glossy paper, they sparkle in the sunlight. It's really pretty.	510000147	
3	Lucia	But the technique is pretty tricky, and I haven't quite mastered it yet. I was practicing just now during my free time.	510000148	
4	Lucia	Yes. How did you know, Commandant?	510000149	
5	Lucia	I've tried many times, but no matter how careful I was, something always felt off. But this one came out perfectly. It's the most beautiful clover I've ever folded.	510000150	
6	Lucia	Which means... maybe the clover's already brought a little luck, just by turning out the way it did.	510000151	
7	Lucia	It's for you, Commandant. I hope it brings you good luck.	510000152	
8	[PlayerName]	(The terminal is still showing yesterday's date. Everything in the lounge has returned to how it was. Past events are happening again... It feels like I've fallen into a time loop.)		
9	[PlayerName]	"(What's happening now mirrors the plot of ""Froggie's Day"" exactly. Even the scenes from my dreams keep pointing to Froggie... Maybe the answer lies in that movie?)"		
10	[PlayerName]	"(""Sincere wishes bring about miracles""—that's the movie's main theme. If this loop follows the same rule, then maybe the way out lies in fulfilling someone's wish. But whose...?)"		
11	[PlayerName]	(Yesterday ended in a hurry. Lucia didn't say anything, but I could see the disappointment in her eyes. Maybe her wish right now... is simply to spend a full day with me together?)		
12	Lucia	...Is something on your mind, Commandant?	510000153	
13	Lucia	Is it related to the confusion you mentioned in your message earlier? If there's something troubling you, I'd like to help.	510000154	
14	Froggie	"Oh, and ribbit, when we see Mama Mole, don't mention anything about the ""loop."""	510000155	
15	Lucia	Are you worried about something?	510000156	
16	Froggie	If Mama Mole finds out about the loop, her wish would become tainted with a desire to help Froggie.	510000157	
17	Froggie	Wish Dewdrops have to stay pure. If any conflicting feelings get mixed in, they'll cloud up and stop working.	510000158	
18	[PlayerName]	(I shouldn't mention the time loop. If Lucia found out, she'd want to help me... and that might taint the purity of her wish.)		
19	[PlayerName]	It's probably just the aftereffects of working too hard. My head's a little foggy—I even misremembered what we talked about.		
20	[PlayerName]	I'd like you to decide what we do today, Lucia. If you have something you want to do, just say the word.		
21	Lucia	Something I want to do?	510000159	
22	Lucia	Oh... I heard Kowloong Restaurant has some new dishes. Maybe we can go try them later?	510000160	
23	[PlayerName]	(Kowloong Restaurant gets insanely crowded around mealtime. I'd better make a reservation in advance.)		
24	[PlayerName]	Sure, but it's still a bit early for food. Is there anywhere else you'd like to go in the meantime?		
25	Lucia	Somewhere I really want to go...	510000161	
26	Lucia	There is this one place, but...	510000162	
27	Lucia	...Please come with me, Commandant.	510000163	
28	[PlayerName]	Is this your first time getting it right?		
29	[PlayerName]	Nothing...		
30	[PlayerName]	What do you want to do today?		
31	[PlayerName]	It should be somewhere you really want to go.		
32	[PlayerName]	That's fine. I'll go anywhere with you.		
33	[PlayerName]	But what is it?
