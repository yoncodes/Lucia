1	Angry Tourist	The world's getting worse day by day...		
2	[PlayerName]	Huh? Are you talking about this place?		
3	Angry Tourist	Such an extravagant building! Who knows why they'd waste resources on something like this. Increasing the mission budget and improving battle supply are much more important!		
4	[PlayerName]	...		
5	Angry Tourist	And this sculpture... I have absolutely no idea what it's supposed to be.		
6	Angry Tourist	What do those WGAA people even do all day?		
7	Angry Tourist	Hmph!
