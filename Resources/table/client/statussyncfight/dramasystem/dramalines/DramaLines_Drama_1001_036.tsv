1	Lucia	Glad you're alright.	510000072	
2	Lucia	Sorry about that... It was an emergency. I put your safety first, but I didn't manage the thrusters well enough.	510000073	
3	Lucia	My scan shows the fireflies are on that floating platform up ahead.	510000065	
4	Froggie	Froggie's legs are too short to make the jump, ribbit...	510000066	
5	Lucia	Commandant, take my hand. I'll fly us over.	510000067	
6	Lucia	We've got the golden fireflies, Commandant. Let's head back—	510000068	
7	Lucia	Commandant, look out—!	510000069	
8	Lucia	Hold on tight, Commandant.	510000070	
9	Lucia	You're not hurt, are you, Commandant?	510000071	
10	Froggie	The forest really is as dangerous as the books say, ribbit! Did you find the golden fireflies up there?	510000074	
11	Lucia	Froggie, are these the fireflies you were looking for?	510000075	
12	Froggie	That's right! Give them to Froggie, ribbit.	510000076	
13	Froggie	Now we just have to give them to Mama Mole!	510000077	
14	Froggie	"Oh, and ribbit, when we see Mama Mole, don't mention anything about the ""loop."""	510000078	
15	Lucia	Are you worried about something?	510000079	
16	Froggie	If Mama Mole finds out about the loop, her wish would become tainted with a desire to help Froggie.	510000080	
17	Froggie	Wish Dewdrops have to stay pure. If any conflicting feelings get mixed in, they'll cloud up and stop working.	510000081	
18	Froggie	Besides, Froggie doesn't want Mama Mole to worry. I want her to experience the moment her wish comes true with nothing but pure happiness.	510000082	
19	Froggie	I've gone on long enough. Let's go give these fireflies to Mama Mole!	510000083	
20		I'm okay.		
21		Just a little dizzy...
