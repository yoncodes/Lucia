1	Nervous Barista	Welcome to Kuroro Coffee, what can I—wait? Gray Raven Commandant!	510000114	
2	Nervous Barista	It really is you! Manager Ross always talks about you. Says you make coffee like a pro. Never thought I'd meet you in person!	510000115	
3	Nervous Barista	I just got my barista license. Making coffee in front of you? That's... a lot. But hey, we've got this interactive thing going on—you can brew your own, try some latte art. Interested?	510000116	
4	Lucia	Maybe another time. Just looking to relax a bit right now.	510000117	
5	Nervous Barista	O-okay... C'mon. Keep calm. Take a breath... W-what can I get for you?	510000118	
6	Lucia	I'll have a Hazelnut Snow Latte with a clover design for the latte art. Commandant—	510000119	
7	Nervous Barista	One Hazelnut Snow, clover design, got it! Coming right up!	510000120	
8	Nervous Barista	Clover, clover, clover... Here you go!	510000121	
9	Lucia	...	510000122	
10	???	...Foam's too thick...	510000123	
11	[PlayerName]	(That voice again...)		
12	Lucia	Commandant...?	510000124	
13	Nervous Barista	How did it end up like this? Oh no, I frothed the milk too much... I'm sorry! I'll make you a new one right away!	510000125	
14	Lucia	...It's alright. This one's fine.	510000126	
15	Nervous Barista	Really? Are you sure? Then, what about you, Gray Raven Commandant?	510000127	
16	Nervous Barista	O-okay, just a moment... No mistakes this time! Please enjoy.	510000128

19		No rush. Take your time.		
20		I'll have the same.
