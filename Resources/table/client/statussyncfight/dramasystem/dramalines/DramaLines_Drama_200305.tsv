1	Ross	[PlayerName]... I don't care about what they say. I only want to keep the shop running.	520005016	
2	Ross	The last thing I want is for things to blow up between us and them and ruin the business.	520005017	
3	Ross	We're still in talks, s-so I wouldn't say it's exactly forced...	520005018	
4	Ross	I did make an appointment to get help with my sleep, but I can't stop worrying about the shop.	520005019	
5	Ross	I've thought about asking someone to watch the place for a bit, but it feels like I'd be running away...	520005020	
6	Ross	"Actually, we do have a humanoid AI who helps run the shop. The one with the nametag that says ""Jason."" With him here, things shouldn't be this hectic..."	520005021	
7	Ross	If you've got some time, [PlayerName], would you mind helping out around the cafe? Jason will support you too.	520005022	
8	Ross	Of course! You'll earn a cut from the sales, [PlayerName]!	520005023	
9		Are they trying to force you into selling the cafe?		
10		Is this some kind of hostile takeover?		
11		Hang in there.		
12		Right now, you need rest more than negotiations.		
13		Your staff is counting on you.		
14		No job is worth your health.		
15		No problem. You go take a break.		
16		Will there be a reward?
