1	[PlayerName]	Feeling better now, Rhea?		
2	Rhea	Mm, I'm fine. Thank you for taking the time to visit me again.		
3	Rhea	...There's something oddly familiar about the person everyone describes in the story... It also mentions a large tree...		
4	Rhea	...That tree, yes! When I was little, I saw a big tree like that. I always loved climbing up into it. I felt like I could see the whole world from up there.		
5	Rhea	I remember now... It was on Earth, my homeland...		
6	Rhea	But then... then something bad happened, I think. I can only remember scattered fragments, and there's still so much I can't recall, I...		
7	[PlayerName]	You've done well. Give yourself more time.		
8	Rhea	Mmm... thank you, [PlayerName]. If it weren't for you, I definitely wouldn't have remembered any of this.		
9	[PlayerName]	Thank Ross and the doctor. Ross has been working hard to find different ways to help you, and the doctor has been very dedicated. That story you just read was written specifically for you.		
10	[PlayerName]	They care a lot about you. Try talking with them more whenever you feel ready.		
11	Rhea	I was too stubborn, always thinking nobody could understand what I was going through... I'll apologize to everyone.		
12	Rhea	I want to go see the Astral Canopy in the central square by myself later... Don't worry, I think I can handle it now.		
13	[PlayerName]	Drink this. It might help you relax.		
14	Rhea	Thank you... Mm, this flavor feels so familiar. Drinking this makes me feel so at peace.		
15	Rhea	This is my first time seeing the Astral Canopy this close... I've tried to approach it before, but I always feel this strange uneasiness and give up halfway every time.		
16	Rhea	So this is what it looks like... It's beautiful. And I'm certain I've seen a similar tree somewhere else, in a warm, beautiful place...		
17	[PlayerName]	(Rhea seems to be doing well.)
