1	Lucia	According to the manual, we can start inputting keywords now.	510000338	
2	Lucia	Then... flowers. Maybe a whole field of them, or even just a single cherry blossom tree in full bloom.	510000339	
3	[PlayerName]	Or maybe both, like—		
4	Lucia	Like the wedding we went through together, right?	510000340	
5	[PlayerName]	Exactly.		
6	Lucia	"Noted. Our first keyword: ""a place where pink wildflowers bloom in abundance."""	510000341	
7	Lucia	"For the second... how about ""beach and ocean""?"	510000342	
8	Lucia	Alright, next is the third keyword.	510000344	
9	Lucia	Are you thinking... fireworks?	510000345	
10	[PlayerName]	That's right. A brilliant fireworks show over the sea. It would be the perfect finishing touch for this memory.		
11	Lucia	Based on the manual, these three required keywords should be enough.	510000346	
12	Lucia	Let me take care of that one. I want this dream to keep a little sense of mystery.	510000347	
13	Lucia	Since there's no guarantee the optional keyword will show up, let's treat it like a surprise waiting to happen.	510000348	
14	Lucia	And as for what that surprise will be—	510000349	
15	Lucia	You'll find out for yourself when we meet again inside this dream.	510000350	
16	[PlayerName]	Let's step into this dream, the one we built together.		
17	Lucia	Putting them together could create something really beautiful and romantic.	510000343	
18	[PlayerName]	Stars might not be bright enough, and birds might be a little too noisy...		
19	[PlayerName]	Still, there's no limit to what a wish can be.		
20	[PlayerName]	It's something I only ever wanted to experience with just the two of us.		
21		How about we come up with a few defining elements first?		
22		Sounds great.		
23		Maybe that's a little greedy...		
24		We've filled the ground. Let's add something for the sky.		
25		If we're by the ocean, then we've definitely got to have...		
26		Now that I think about it, there's something I've always wanted.		
27		We still have one optional keyword left.		
28		Everything's set. Let's begin.
