1	Talkative Waiter	Customers, please take a number and wait in line. We appreciate your cooperation.	510000212	
2	[PlayerName]	We have a reservation.		
3	Talkative Waiter	Let me check... Oh! Your turn just came up. Your table's ready on the second floor. Right this way, please.	510000213	
4	Lucia	Besides the new dishes, is there anything else you'd like to try, Commandant?	510000215	
5	Lucia	These two are highly rated. Lots of people say they're unique and have a really refreshing flavor.	510000216	
6	[PlayerName]	Then let's go with your picks.		
7	Busy Waiter	Here are your dishes. Enjoy the meal.	510000218	
8	Lucia	There's more food than I expected.	510000219	
9	Lucia	Turning simple ingredients into something so special... Kowloong's culinary skills really are something else.	510000220	
10	Lucia	Try it, Commandant.	510000221	
11	Lucia	...A photo?	510000222	
12	[PlayerName]	It's not every day we get a feast like this. Let's capture the moment.		
13	Lucia	Do we both need to be in it?	510000223	
14	[PlayerName]	Of course! Look at the camera—		
15	Lucia	...Okay. Is this angle all right, Commandant?	510000224	
16	Lucia	Cheese.	510000225	
17	[PlayerName]	Photo's done. Let's eat.		
18	Lucia	Commandant, you've got some sauce on your lip. Let me wipe it off.	510000226	
19	Lucia	Let's enjoy these dishes together, Commandant.	510000227	
20	Lucia	Really? Hold still, let me take a look...	510000228	
21	Lucia	The server mentioned that some of these dishes taste even better when paired together.	510000229	
22	[PlayerName]	Which ones? Let's try them.		
23	Lucia	Like this one and this one, Commandant—	510000230	
24		(Lucia lifts the food with her chopsticks, and you take a bite. The blend of flavors spreads and deepens as you chew.)		
25	Lucia	Pairing different ingredients like this creates a whole new flavor. Looks like the chef had that in mind all along.	510000231	
26	Lucia	Want to try a few other combinations, Commandant?	510000232	
27	[PlayerName]	Want to try it, Lucia?		
28	Lucia	Sure.	510000233	
29	[PlayerName]	So? How is it?		
30	Lucia	It tastes really good. If we get the chance, let's try cooking Kowloong-style dishes together sometime.	510000234	
31		Got any recommendations, Lucia?		
32		I'll have one of everything.		
33		Want to take a photo together first?		
34		(Sample the dish)		
35		Yep. Say cheese—		
36		Thanks, Lucia.		
37		Think there's some on the other side too...		
38		I think these few would go great together too.		
39		I'm getting a bit full.		
40		All right, then... I'll order one of each.	510000217
