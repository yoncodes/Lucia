1	[PlayerName]	After traveling down so many paths, it's only natural to worry about getting lost someday.		
2	Lucia	Not knowing where to find you, Commandant... that's the ending I refuse to accept.	510000408	
3		But you've found an answer now, haven't you?		
4	Lucia	Yes. It's something you helped me see, Commandant.	510000409	
5	Lucia	Time and space can't be trusted. Anything around us can change without warning.	510000410	
6	Lucia	But between us, between two hearts that still carry warmth, there has to be something that won't change.	510000411	
7	Lucia	As long as I'm here on this side of the road, and you're still there on the other, I won't lose my way.	510000413	
8	Lucia	In the end... I'll always find you.	510000414	
9		And I'll always keep walking toward you, too.		
10	[PlayerName]	Our vows, our markers, you and me—none of that will ever change, right?		
11	Lucia	Maybe the cycle isn't over yet. Maybe we'll forget something again next time—	510000417	
12	Lucia	But this Dreamweaver world we created together will last forever.	510000418	
13	Lucia	I used to rely on markers to help me find my way, but what if those markers change, or disappear?	510000407	
14	Lucia	Even if we forget, we'll remember again one day. Even if we're apart, we'll still find our way back to each other.	510000412	
15	Lucia	Right. It has nothing to do with the road ahead. It comes from us. As long as we never let go of each other's hands, our bond will never fade.	510000415	
16	Lucia	And that's exactly what we're doing now.	510000416
