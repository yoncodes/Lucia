1	Kuwokwok	...We found... our missing spices... in your restaurant's... hamburgers. How... do you explain that!	510002081	
2	Shop-speare	Ocean Heart always makes its own seasonings! Don't go spreading lies and ruining our reputation, rawr!	510002080	
3	Kuwokwok	After comparing... the samples matched... 96.87%! You clearly... stole... Akdilek's spices!	510002082	
4	Shop-speare	Impossible! Every ingredient in this store is properly sourced and logged, rawr!	510002083	
5	Kuwokwok	[PlayerName]! You're just in time... Please... help us settle this—	510002084	
6	Kuwokwok	A few days ago... we lost a batch... of special spices. But today... we found them... in Ocean Heart's burgers.	510002085	
7	Shop-speare	If we really stole them, why would we display them so openly, rawr?!	510002086	
8	Shop-speare	Gray Raven Commandant, could you investigate this case? I swear, Ocean Heart didn't steal anything, rawr!	510002087

10	Kuwokwok	If you find out... who really stole the spices... we'll join too.	510002089	
11	Lucia	Both sides are talking past each other. This shouting won't solve anything. Shall we accept their request, Commandant?	510002090	
12	[PlayerName]	Of course. It's in the best interest of the square.		
13	[PlayerName]	I'll start investigating right away. Where were the spices stolen from?		
14	Kuwokwok	The guild... has a warehouse... Coordinates sent... Surveillance was... jammed during the theft.	510002091	
15	Kuwokwok	Please... Commandant... we're counting on you... to find out what happened.	510002092
