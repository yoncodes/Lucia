1	Ed	[PlayerName]... things have been getting worse around here lately.	520005005	
2	Ed	Looks like the boss got into a bit of trouble out there. Lately, we've been getting harassed by some really shady, menacing-looking folks.	520005006	
3	[PlayerName]	Did they say anything?		
4	Ed	I've been busy with customers, so I haven't really caught what they've been saying to him.	520005007	
5	Ed	"I just remember them throwing around words like ""takeover,"" and they weren't exactly polite about it."	520005008	
6		Yeah, I talked to Mr. Ross.		
7		Is it a business issue?		
8		I see.		
9		Got it.
