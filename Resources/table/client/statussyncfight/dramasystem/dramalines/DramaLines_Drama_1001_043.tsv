1	Lucia	Oh. The sky's starting to change. Let's stay here and watch how this dream comes to an end.	510000397	
2	Lucia	Probably because I finally figured some things out.	510000398	
3	Lucia	About what gave rise to this wish in the first place.	510000399	
4	Lucia	It started as small thoughts in fleeting moments, building up little by little.	510000400	
5	Lucia	There were a lot of those moments. When I saw others with their partners, when I wanted to share something with you, or when missions forced us to part for a while...	510000401	
6	Lucia	It's strange. Each moment held a different feeling, but together, they combined into one single wish.	510000402	
7	Lucia	"Yes. A wish... named ""Commandant."""	510000403	
8	Lucia	Even with all the memories I already have of you, I still selfishly feel it's not enough.	510000404	
9	Lucia	Sometimes it's war, sometimes it's the unexpected. Like this loop—there's no telling what the future might bring.	510000405	
10	Lucia	What if something wipes those memories away? That thought used to scare me.	510000406	
11		You seem more at ease now.		
12		The same wish?		
13		...		
14		I think about that too, sometimes.
