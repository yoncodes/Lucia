1	Customer on a Call	Yeah, yeah... Alright. I get it. I'll do it your way...	510000132	
2	Lucia	That was close. I almost bumped into them... Thank you, Commandant.	510000133	
3	Lucia	There are some free seats. Let's sit here.	510000134	
4	Lucia	Commandant, you seemed a little off just now at the front desk... and earlier, at the Kowloong Restaurant too. Are you not feeling well?	510000135	
5	Lucia	Auditory and visual hallucinations...	510000136	
6	Lucia	Could it be from the Immersion Projector? Or maybe just fatigue building up lately...?	510000137	
7	Lucia	I'm a little worried, Commandant. You might need to get some proper rest soon.	510000138	
8	Lucia	There's still a lot I wanted to do with you today, but your health is more important than anything else.	510000139	
9	Lucia	You should probably take it easy for the rest of the day. Let's just sit here at the cafe for a while. I'll stay with you. We can talk, or just relax and enjoy the quiet.	510000140	
10	Lucia	We have plenty of time. Use today to rest and recover, and tomorrow we'll head out and enjoy ourselves.	510000141	
11	Lucia	Of course. Stay as long as you like. I'll be right here with you.	510000142	
12	Lucia	All right. When you've finished your drink, let's take a nice, slow walk back.	510000143	
13		Actually—		
14		So for today...		
15		Stay with me a little longer.		
16		Let's head back after I finish this coffee.
