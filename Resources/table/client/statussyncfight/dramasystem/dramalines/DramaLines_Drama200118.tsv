1	Vera	I heard the square was thriving under someone's leadership. This is it?	510002160	
2	Vera	I was assigned to investigate a case linked to Kurono. Following the trail led me to a group called the Flourish Guild.	510002161	
3	Vera	And wouldn't you know it, the vacationing Gray Raven Commandant just happens to be serving here as the Chief Commissioner, locked in a battle of wits with my target.	510002162	
4	Vera	The Flourish Guild has been working behind the scenes to sabotage the square project you're leading...	510002165	
5	Vera	That means this marquee incident was likely a blatant act of sabotage by them too.	510002166	
6	Vera	What a bunch of shameless scoundrels... I enjoy dealing with fools like this. Who knows, maybe we'll wrap this up in time to have dinner after.	510002167	
7	Vera	Of course. I'm also curious to see what surprises you've got for me off the battlefield.	510002168	
8	Vera	Since the enemy made the first move, let's start by looking into what caused the marquee malfunction.	510002169	
9	Vera	I took a quick look at the marquee. No signs of physical damage. Which means...	510002170	
10	Vera	Exactly. We'll check the modification logs and see if we can trace it back to whoever did it.	510002171	
11	Vera	I just can't stand people getting away with things right under your nose. Time to remind them—if you're going to cause trouble, be ready to pay the price.	510002163	
12	Vera	Perfect. I've been wanting to see what kind of bold little rats would dare go up against you.	510002164	
13		Vera?		
14		It's just a technical adjustment...		
15		So, you're here to help, Vera?		
16		Since we're after the same thing, let's work together.		
17		You seem pretty confident.		
18		They've got Kurono backing them, after all.		
19		Someone tampered with the marquee data from the inside?		
20		"Good thing I know just the right ""expert"" for the job."		
21		In that case, let's sync up on what we know.
