1	[PlayerName]	Dear Commercial Square business owners, my name is [PlayerName]. I'm ordered by BCC to be the Chief Commissioner from today.		
2	[PlayerName]	To maintain order in the square and foster a healthy market for all, we've decided to form a mutual aid group—the Square Business Owners' Committee.		
3	[PlayerName]	The committee will oversee fair distribution of BCC-provided resources, operate under group supervision, and prevent any action that harms our shared interests.		
4	[PlayerName]	Joining the committee is completely voluntary. You're all welcome to sign up, and I'll personally oversee its operations.		
5	???	Apologies, Gray Raven Commandant. But I must oppose your proposal.	510002033	
6	[PlayerName]	And you are...?		
7	???	Director of Market Expansion at the Flourish Guild, founder of the Commercial Alliance, angel investor in the district—	510002034	
8	Hertha	Councilor Hertha Buchanan.	510002035	
9	Hertha	Since we're all gathered here, I'll speak plainly: the Flourish Guild is against this committee.	510002036	
10	Hertha	I admire your military record, but commercial matters should be handled by professionals.	510002037	
11	Hertha	The Commercial District is built on transparency and fair competition. The authorities just need to collect their taxes. Why meddle in local commerce?	510002038	
12	Hertha	"How do you know this ""guild"" is actually the Flourish Guild?"	510002044	
13	[PlayerName]	I've already turned it over to the proper authorities. The investigation will determine if you're involved.		
14	Hertha	Tch! Either way, you still can't prove that list has anything to do with us!	510002049	
15	Male Business Owner	My, my, Councilor Hertha. Keep flailing like this and your family name's going to be the laughingstock of the district.	510002050	
16	Hertha	Huh? And who the heck are you to insult my family?	510002051	
17	Female Business Owner	I-I believe in [PlayerName]. I want to join the committee.	510002052	
18	Robot Business Owner	Statement: In line with the General Manager's wishes, Fancy Food will also cooperate with the Gray Raven Commandant.	510002053	
19	Hertha	You...! Fine. So you're all turning against me.	510002054	
20	Hertha	No matter. I'll wait for you amateurs to go bankrupt, then take over. And when that happens, I'll have you begging on your knees.	510002055	
21	Hertha	Best of luck in your work, [PlayerName].	510002056	
22	[PlayerName]	...That concludes my inauguration speech. No matter what lies ahead, I will fulfill my duties and do everything I can to build a fair and safe market for all.		
23	[PlayerName]	I believe that with everyone's support—both business owners and the council—we'll achieve the goals of the square's development plan.		
24	Crowd	(Cheers)		
25	[PlayerName]	According to the government's Commercial District Management Regulations, BCC has the authority to appoint a Chief Commissioner to oversee development zones.		
26	[PlayerName]	As the Commissioner, my oversight of the square fully aligns with those regulations.		
27	[PlayerName]	"You, on the other hand—the so-called ""Flourish Guild""—have been bullying merchants behind the scenes and disrupting the market."		
28	Hertha	Management... regulations?	510002041	
29	Hertha	And... who gives you the right to accuse us of disrupting the market? I won't stand for that kind of slander!	510002042	
30	Hertha	I know you mean well, Commandant, but that doesn't give you the right to meddle in business.	510002039	
31	[PlayerName]	(I need to think carefully about how to respond...)		
32	Hertha	Answer my question directly, Commandant!	510002040	
33	Hertha	Wh-what is this?!	510002043	
34	[PlayerName]	I saw someone delivering threatening letters to merchants here at the square. This list was dropped during the incident. It names all the guild's intended targets.		
35	Hertha	If you can't back up your words, then we have no reason to follow your lead.	510002045	
36	Hertha	Hmph. Other merchants, huh?	510002046	
37	Hertha	Anyone here care to admit they told the Commissioner such baseless nonsense?	510002047	
38	Hertha	See? No one!	510002048	
39		(Cite the Commercial District Management Regulations in response)		
40		I'm just trying to help.		
41		I'm just following orders...		
42		I have a list right here.		
43		I refuse to answer you.		
44		I heard it from the other merchants.
