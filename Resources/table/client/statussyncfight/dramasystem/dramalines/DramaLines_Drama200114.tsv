1	Kuwokwok	Flourish... Guild...	510002134	
2	Kuwokwok	But... how did the... spices end up... in Ocean Heart's food?	510002135	
3	Lucia	The Flourish Guild likely slipped the spices into Ocean Heart's ingredients to stir up conflict between you.	510002136	
4	Shop-speare	No wonder the patties tasted weird lately, rawr!	510002137	
5	Kuwokwok	I see... So... we wrongfully blamed... Ocean Heart.	510002138	
6	Shop-speare	Told you we were innocent, rawr!	510002139	
7	Kuwokwok	On behalf... of the Akdilek branch... I sincerely... apologize to Ocean Heart...	510002140	
8	Shop-speare	It's fine. What matters is we cleared things up. You were victims too, and we'll all be doing business here together, rawr!	510002141	
9	Kuwokwok	Thank you... Gray Raven Commandant... and Miss Lucia.	510002142	
10	Lucia	You're very welcome. And please continue supporting the commandant's work going forward.	510002143	
11	Kuwokwok	Gray Raven Commandant... to show our support... Akdilek... is ready to join the committee.	510002144	
12	Shop-speare	Ocean Heart will keep its word too, and follow your lead, rawr!	510002145	
13	Lucia	It seems we've successfully foiled the Flourish Guild's plot to turn the merchants against each other, Commandant.	510002146	
14	Lucia	I only did what I could to help you, Commandant.	510002147	
15	Lucia	Still, I didn't expect the trouble behind this square to involve a group like Kurono.	510002148	
16	Lucia	I can't shake the feeling this isn't over yet... For now, I'd like to stay close and support you, Commandant.	510002149	
17	[PlayerName]	The square's construction will likely take a while to finish.		
18	[PlayerName]	While I'm on leave, I'll be counting on you to take care of the squad's missions.		
19	Lucia	Understood. I'll handle squad operations during this time. Please don't worry, Commandant.	510002150	
20	Lucia	And if you need any help with things here, contact me right away. No matter what it is, I'm always here for you.	510002151	
21	Lucia	It's your well-earned time off, so please try to get some rest while you can.	510002152	
22	Lucia	This is... a voucher for the square attractions?	510002153	
23	Lucia	Of course, Commandant. I'd love to.	510002154	
24	Lucia	I'm really looking forward to seeing the square thrive.	510002155	
25		It's what a Commissioner is here for.		
26		Let's talk about our reward.		
27		Thanks to you, Lucia.		
28		Got it.		
29		Oh, and take this.		
30		When the square is finally complete, would you visit with me?
