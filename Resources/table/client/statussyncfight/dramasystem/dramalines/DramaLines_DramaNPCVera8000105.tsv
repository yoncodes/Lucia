1	Vera	What a surprise. I just got back from a mission, and here you are, Commandant!		
2	Vera	What, Nikola too busy for my report and sent you instead?		
3		I was just passing by.		
4		I knew you'd be on this flight.		
5		I still have a mission to finish. I'll get going.		
6	Vera	See? This dock connects everywhere, and it's right by the Commercial District. Running into someone isn't strange at all... especially someone as unpredictable as you, Commandant.		
7		Don't tell me you came here just to...		
8	Vera	Don't read too much into it. The last mission is still under review, and the next one hasn't been assigned. I just came here to relax.		
9		Did you come alone?		
10	Vera	Why so curious about my schedule? Don't tell me you're off-duty too?		
11	Vera	Then how about sharing some of this free time with me? Keep me company?		
12	Vera	Oh? How did you know?		
13		I saw it on the transport schedule.		
14	Vera	That's thoughtful. But you didn't come here just to chat, did you?		
15		Some new shops opened in the Commercial District. I think you'll like them.		
16	Vera	Sounds good. I just finished my report and have nothing to do. I'm curious to see where you'll take me.		
17	Vera	If your choice isn't good enough, be ready for a little punishment, Commandant.		
18	Vera	What a coincidence. I also need to report in, so no time to chat. See you next time.
