1	Jason	"I am an Autonomous Synthesis Operator, Nano-Constructed, Model 9000. Though personally, I prefer the name ""Jason."""	520005024	
2	Jason	I like your directness.	520005027	
3	Jason	Then let's get straight to the point. Golden parachute, white knight, or scorched earth—which strategy does [PlayerName] prefer?	520005028	
4	Jason	These are the best strategies I could come up with based on current market conditions.	520005035	
5	Jason	Still, I understand. Humans aren't purely logical beings.	520005036	
6	Jason	So, are you ready for the real challenge, [PlayerName]?	520005037	
7	[PlayerName]	Yeah. Ross loves Kuroro Coffee too much to give in, and I won't let him down.		
8	Jason	Turning the business around and stopping their scheme head-on... that's the toughest path you could've picked.	520005038	
9	Jason	But since that's your choice, I'll support you however I can.	520005039	
10	Jason	In any case, I assume you're already aware of Manager Ross's situation.	520005026	
11	Jason	Understood. [PlayerName] prefers more formal naming. Perhaps that's due to your training at the F.O.S. Military Command College?	520005025	
12	Jason	It simply means negotiating a compensation package ahead of time, so if they fire Ross, they'll have to pay him a huge severance.	520005029	
13	Jason	From a human perspective, it's certainly an apt term.	520005030	
14	Jason	Exactly. We find a friendly buyer to acquire Kuroro Coffee first. That way, Ross won't be at the mercy of the hostile group.	520005031	
15	Jason	What do you think about reaching out to Kowloong Restaurant?	520005032	
16	Jason	"Yes. We mechanoids typically call this a ""self-destruct protocol."" Basically, we lower the drink quality and make the place less cozy, to drive down the cafe's value so it's no longer worth acquiring."	520005033	
17	Jason	But I believe in Ross. Once this blows over, he'll bounce back stronger than ever.	520005034	
18		Alright, Jason it is.		
19		Autonomous Synth... model 9000 something?		
20		Golden parachute?		
21		White knight sounds safer.		
22		Scorched earth... doesn't sound too promising.		
23		Ross already told me everything.		
24		Let's do our best.		
25		Someone's attempting a hostile takeover.		
26		Someone's trying to steal what he worked so hard to build.		
27		Ross would never abandon his team.		
28		They're not looking to expand right now.		
29		Pretty much what I expected...
