1	[PlayerName]	Jos, I need your help.		
2	Jos	...Tch. I'm not telling you anything.	510002193	
3	[PlayerName]	I'll report your cooperation truthfully to the authorities. The more you talk, the better it'll be for you.		
4	Jos	Don't know.	510002194	
5	Vera	Heh. This is a waste of time. Hand her over and I'll make her talk.	510002195	
6	[PlayerName]	Jos, you know who's standing next to me, don't you?		
7	Jos	...	510002196	
8	Jos	I-I don't know.	510002197	
9	Vera	[PlayerName], I'm feeling a little thirsty. Go grab me an electrolyte drink.	510002198	
10	Vera	Just get it from somewhere nearby. By the time you're back, I should be about done here.	510002199	
11	Vera	Alright, just the two of us now. Let me think... how should we spend this time together?	510002200	
12	Jos	W-what are you going to do?	510002201	
13	Vera	You know, even the most tight-lipped people can't help but whimper when a sharp lance tears through their throat.	510002202	
14	Vera	People like you always think you're more important than you are, like keeping a few secrets will make the world see you as some kind of martyr.	510002203	
15	Vera	But the truth is, there are seven or eight more scumbags waiting their turn in that cell. If the ones up front stay quiet, I'll start slitting throats so the rest can hear it loud and clear...	510002204	
16	Jos	Stay back! Don't hurt me!	510002205	
17	Vera	Someone always breaks and gives me the answers. And when they do, the ones who died before them? All for nothing.	510002206	
18	Jos	I-I'll tell you everything, please!	510002207	
19	Jos	Well, there is something, but...	510002210	
20	Vera	Hmm?	510002211	
21	Jos	B-but every time we met, it was near Sequence Square. They'd blindfold us and lead us through an underground passage to a dark room...	510002212	
22	Vera	How long does it take to get there from Sequence Square?	510002213	
23	Jos	About... ten minutes or so.	510002214	
24	Vera	Anything unusual around that dark room? Like the decor, the setting, anything at all?	510002215	
25	Jos	I've only been there twice. All I remember is that it was big, dark, kind of like a warehouse...	510002216	
26	Jos	As for the setting... I vaguely remember hearing jazz music coming from upstairs last time.	510002217	
27	Vera	...Jazz music? Anything else?	510002218	
28	Jos	I... I've told you everything I know. Please, just let me go...	510002219	
29	Vera	Tch. One more whimper out of you and I'll really slit your throat.	510002220	
30	Vera	Sit there and stay quiet until [PlayerName] gets back.	510002221	
31	[PlayerName]	Thank you, Vera.		
32	Vera	Dealing with a coward like her was no trouble. Better than those idiots who make me get blood all over myself.	510002222	
33	Vera	Back to business. Based on the information we got, there's only one place that fits the profile in the whole Commercial District...	510002223	
34	Vera	Then let's go ask the manager directly and see what he has to say.	510002227	
35	Jos	I was just doing a job for money. I don't know anything else... I swear! I'm telling the truth!	510002209	
36	Jos	It's Hertha from the Flourish Guild. I only joined recently. Just delivered a few threatening letters, that's all!	510002208	
37	Vera	Exactly. And if Jos is right, that secret base should be right under Stella Brew.	510002226	
38	Vera	Aren't you close with the owner of that shop? Has he ever mentioned any kind of hidden passage in there?	510002225	
39	Vera	Did you get hit by a car on your way back? Are you saying they started at Sequence Square, walked in a circle, and ended up right back where they started?	510002224	
40		Who are you working for?		
41		Why are you interfering with the development plans?		
42		Do you have a fixed base?		
43		I'm trying to help you.		
44		If you don't start talking, you're going to regret it.		
45		Stella Brew.		
46		Kuroro Coffee.		
47		Sequence Square.		
48		Alright, let's go.		
49		I've never heard of any underground facility at Stella Brew.		
50		I know that place pretty well. I don't think there's anything like that.
