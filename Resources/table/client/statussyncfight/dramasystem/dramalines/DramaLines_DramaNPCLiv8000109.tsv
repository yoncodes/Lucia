1	Liv	Oh, Commandant, you're here at Sequence Square too.		
2		Liv, did you help out at the Star of Life today?		
3		Ah... Achoo!		
4		Are you looking at the Astral Canopy, Liv?		
5		It's getting late, Liv. I should get going.		
6	Liv	A group of patients was discharged yesterday. Seeing them recover and walk out of the ward on their own really made me happy.		
7	Liv	So today the Star of Life isn't too busy, and Professor Hippocrates told me I could take the day off.		
8	Liv	I thought I had a bit of time, so I came to wander around Sequence Square and buy some supplies for the squad.		
9	Liv	Are you free right now, Commandant? Want to come with me?		
10	Liv	Commandant... are you feeling unwell?		
11		My nose is just a little itchy.		
12	Liv	Please stay still, let me take a look.		
13		Liv performs a basic medical examination on you.		
14	Liv	Everything looks fine. Your vitals are normal, but your blood sugar is a little low. Did you miss a meal today, Commandant?		
15	Liv	Don't skip meals just because you're busy with work, okay?		
16	Liv	I know a really good healthy restaurant nearby. Let's go there later, Commandant.		
17	Liv	Yes, when I look at this lush Astral Canopy, I always think of the plants at the Star of Life.		
18	Liv	Many of them were planted by the medical staff and the patients together. Watching something they planted grow and thrive gives the patients hope and helps them face treatment with a better mindset.		
19	Liv	These plants aren't as complicated as humans or Constructs. They just need a little sunlight, water, and the right soil. Then they start to grow, quietly healing the world around them... and the people who look at them.		
20		So that's how the plants on the Star of Life came to be.		
21		Next time, let's plant one together.		
22	Liv	Alright, let's think of this as a little comfort for our soldiers then.		
23	Liv	Alright, take care, Commandant. And make sure you get some real rest during your time off.
