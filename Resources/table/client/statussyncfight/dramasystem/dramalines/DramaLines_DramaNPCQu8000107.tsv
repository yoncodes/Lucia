1	Qu	You're here.		
2	Qu	Babylonia's Commercial District is huge. I searched forever and couldn't find the exit, but I did stumble upon a Kowloong-style restaurant.		
3		And it's not just restaurants. There are Kowloong-themed shops too.		
4		Have you tried the food there yet?		
5		And it's not just Kowloong. There are shops with all kinds of regional styles.		
6		I've still got things to do. Bye!		
7	Qu	I just passed through the Commercial Square. Funny how little trinkets nobody cared about in Kowloong are suddenly so popular here in Babylonia.		
8		"There's an old saying in Kowloong... ""What's rare is precious."""		
9	Qu	True, some things are rare here in Babylonia... Looks like you know quite a bit about Kowloong culture.		
10	Qu	What's interesting is that many of those Kowloong trinkets have been given a fresh, modern twist here in Babylonia.		
11	Qu	Maybe I should bring back a few special souvenirs. Help me pick some out.		
12	Qu	I tried the food already. Tastes good, but something's missing.		
13		Missing what exactly?		
14	Qu	...Maybe the feeling of real life. It's not just about the dishes themselves, it's about culture, tradition, and human touch.		
15	Qu	"But I'm not being harsh on Babylonia's Kowloong cuisine. What I mean is... it's missing ""you."""		
16	Qu	So you'll keep me company. Got it?		
17	Qu	Looks like you know this place well. Be my guide.		
18		With pleasure.		
19	Qu	This newly renovated Commercial District is fascinating. It always reminds me of scenes from the Golden Age.		
20	Qu	The shops here all look different, with so many things on display. Even Earth's busiest markets weren't much better than this. Walk with me. I want to look around and see what catches my interest.		
21	Qu	Sure. And if we get the chance later, we can travel together again.
