1	Lucia	There you are, Commandant.	510000011	
2	Lucia	I recently learned a new folding technique that makes the clovers more three-dimensional. When you use glossy paper, they sparkle in the sunlight. It's really pretty.	510000012	
3	Lucia	But the technique is pretty tricky, and I haven't quite mastered it yet. I was practicing just now during my free time.	510000013	
4	Lucia	I've tried many times, but no matter how careful I was, something always felt off. But this one came out perfectly. It's the most beautiful clover I've ever folded.	510000014	
5	Lucia	Which means... maybe the clover's already brought a little luck, just by turning out the way it did.	510000015	
6	Lucia	It's for you, Commandant. I hope it brings you good luck.	510000016	
7	[PlayerName]	(Looking closely, you find this origami clover almost identical to the one in the lounge.)		
8	Lucia	By the way, Commandant, what was that movie you mentioned earlier?	510000017	
9	Lucia	You heard it from me...? But until just now, I hadn't heard anything about a Froggie movie.	510000018	
10	Lucia	If what you're saying is true, there should be a record in the terminal. I checked our communication logs. Nothing came up.	510000019	
11	Lucia	Maybe the recent mission overload has been affecting your rest, Commandant...?	510000020	
12	Lucia	Either way, since we've finally got some time off, you should take this chance to relax and recharge, Commandant.	510000021	
13	Lucia	Why not start now? I'm curious about that Froggie movie you mentioned. Would you go with me?	510000022	
14		(It looks just like the one in the lounge...)		
15		It's beautifully folded.		
16		I can tell you put a lot of care into it.		
17		(Explain the event and movie details to Lucia)		
18		Same here.		
19		I might've just gotten things mixed up. Been busy lately.		
20		It's not that bad.		
21		Sure. Let's go.
