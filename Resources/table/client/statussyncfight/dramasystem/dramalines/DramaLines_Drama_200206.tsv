1	Liv	So there is a hidden mission. I also agree that we should give the mission's reward to Lee as a gift.	510003035	
2	Liv	According to the rules they just announced... Once we finish the event, we can pick up some souvenirs from the staff. After that, we head to Sequence Square, check in using the store's photo system, and claim the final reward.	510003036	
3	Vera	This place is seriously understaffed. There's absolutely no service here.	510003037	
4	Vera	I tried. I wanted to order and sit down, but the staff said they're short-handed. No clean tables, and we have to order at the bar.	510003038	
5	Lucia	We might run into the same issue when picking up our souvenirs...	510003039	
6	Liv	To speed things up... What do you have in mind, Commandant?	510003040	
7	[PlayerName]	According to the staff, the photos taken at the check-in spot take time to be uploaded to the system. After the event, we could split into two groups and handle things in parallel.		
8	Liv	Got it. After the event, I'll head straight to Sequence Square and upload the photo data to the system in advance.	510003041	
9	Lucia	Then I'll stay here with the Commandant. Once we get the souvenirs, we'll head over and meet up to finish the check-in mission.	510003042	
10	Haley	Hello there! It's time for your group to begin the experience. Please head to the entrance.	510003043	
11	Haley	This table's finally been cleared. The young lady may be seated now as well.	510003044	
12	Vera	Took you long enough. If it had gone on any longer, I'd have walked out.	510003045	
13	Vera	[PlayerName], let me know how the experience turns out.	510003046	
14	Vera	I'll be waiting to hear all about it.	510003047	
15		But the staff looks completely overwhelmed right now.		
16		Vera? I thought you found a seat already.		
17		Why don't we come up with a plan to speed things up?		
18		That should save us some time.		
19		Sounds like a perfect plan.
