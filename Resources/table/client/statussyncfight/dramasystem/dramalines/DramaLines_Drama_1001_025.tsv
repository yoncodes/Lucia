1	Lucia	Can something you've already seen... still make you feel that way?	510000353	
2	[PlayerName]	So this is the surprise you were talking about?		
3	Lucia	"It's a ""surprise""... for both of us."	510000351	
4	Lucia	You were really lost in the moment just now, weren't you, Commandant?	510000352	
5	[PlayerName]	Did you already have this dress in mind when you entered the keywords?		
6	Lucia	No, I just asked for something that held a special place in our memories.	510000354	
7	Lucia	Once I saw I was wearing it in the Dreamweaver, I understood right away.	510000355	
8	Lucia	Our memories chose it for us.	510000356	
9	Lucia	If we want this to be truly unique, then every detail matters.	510000357	
10	Lucia	[PlayerName], do you want to know why I saved it for the final keyword?	510000358	
11	Lucia	Because... I wanted to add more meaning to the vows we made in it.	510000359	
12	Lucia	"""I vow to keep this miracle alive... until the end of time... or life itself."""	510000360	
13	Lucia	Like you said once, if it's my wish, then it's okay to want a little more, isn't it?	510000361	
14	Lucia	The crowd watching wasn't enough. The church bells, even the sea of flowers weren't enough either.	510000362	
15	Lucia	Before I realized it, I wanted more to witness our vows. Everything we had still didn't feel like enough.	510000363	
16	Lucia	I wanted this dress to carry even more of our memories and hopes, in this little world that belongs only to us.	510000364	
17	[PlayerName]	Then let it be part of our vows too. A constant reminder of everything we've shared.		
18	Lucia	It will still be with us, holding our memories.	510000365	
19	[PlayerName]	You're not the only one who planned a surprise, Lucia. I've got something too.		
20	[PlayerName]	I asked the staff for a little bonus. It's a floating camera from the Dreamweaver.		
21	Lucia	So now even more things are here to witness our vows?	510000366	
22	[PlayerName]	Come on. Our dream is just getting started.		
23		This dress...		
24		It's breathtaking.		
25		Because it means that much to me.		
26		Because of our wedding.		
27		Whatever the future holds, I fear nothing.		
28		Now and forevermore.		
29		No matter where we are, whether this moment belongs to the past or the future...		
30		You can never have too many good memories.
