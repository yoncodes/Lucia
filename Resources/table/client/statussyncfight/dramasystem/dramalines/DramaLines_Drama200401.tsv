1	Lucia	There you are, Commandant.	510002285	
2	Lucia	I was... observing people's expressions.	510002286	
3	Lucia	Yes. Look, Commandant. Some are families who came together, and others are tourists here on their own.	510002287	
4	Lucia	Constructs, humans, even mechanoids... they all seem to be caught up in the lively atmosphere. You can see it in their smiles.	510002288	
5	Lucia	Am I...? Maybe I got swept up in the celebration too, without even realizing it.	510002289	
6	Lucia	Not long ago, this square was just a quiet, empty street. It's only because of you, and everyone's efforts, that it's been brought back to life like this.	510002290	
7	Lucia	This may not be a battlefield, but I know there are still enemies hiding in the shadows. So every smile here... it's well-earned.	510002291	
8	Lucia	You've worked hard lately, Commandant.	510002292	
9	Lucia	Will you take a walk with me, Commandant?	510002293	
10	Lucia	You've always been going around as a Commissioner. But today, during this celebration, I hope you can put that aside, at least for a little while, and take time for yourself.	510002294	
11	Lucia	Let's just be two ordinary visitors today, and enjoy the celebration like everyone else. Is that alright, Commandant?	510002295	
12		Lucia.		
13		What were you just looking at?		
14		Expressions?		
15		You're smiling the same way.		
16		I wouldn't say that.		
17		It hasn't been easy.		
18		Sure thing.		
19		Let's go.
