1	Vera	All those bustling places outside, and you bring me somewhere so quiet and secluded?	510002332	
2	Vera	That depends on what exactly you had in mind.	510002333	
3	Vera	Just ordering? How boring. Let's make a game of it.	510002334	
4	Vera	They have a self-service station, right? How about we each make a drink for the other?	510002335	
5	Vera	Look at you, raring to go. I'll start first.	510002336	
6	Vera	To handle all kinds of missions, you need a few special skills. Like—being alone in a quiet corner with the Gray Raven Commandant.	510002337	
7	Vera	So, Commandant, what kind of flavor are you in the mood for?	510002338	
8	Vera	"Oh, you do love a challenge. Alright, one ""Gray Raven Commandant"" coming right up."	510002339	
9	Vera	"Here you go, one ""[PlayerName]"" special. Enjoy!"	510002340	
10		(The moment it hits your throat, it's like a burst of fiery spice ignites your taste buds.)		
11	[PlayerName]	Cough—cough—		
12	Vera	"Oh dear, that was our ""Blazing Inferno."" This next one is what you actually ordered."	510002341	
13	Vera	So sorry for the inconvenience!	510002342	
14	Vera	Hmm... What to do? I know, I'll taste it first for you.	510002343	
15	Vera	Now there's no excuse. Your turn, Commandant.	510002344	
16	Vera	Tsk. Open up—	510002345	
17	Vera	So? How is it?	510002346	
18	Vera	"You've got taste. I'll remember this ""[PlayerName]"" recipe. When you're craving it again, come beg me for another."	510002349	
19	Vera	Hmm... The noise was unbearable, the decor was painfully tacky, and the food? Bland. Out of 100, I'd give it a negative 10.	510002350	
20	Vera	But [PlayerName] was reasonably well-behaved at my side. I suppose that's worth about 70 points.	510002351	
21	Vera	"All together... just enough to pass. You did okay in the ""satisfy Vera"" category."	510002352	
22	Vera	"As for your ""reward,"" I've already decided."	510002353	
23	Vera	"Our little ""date"" can go on a little longer... through tonight, until morning comes."	510002354	
24	Vera	What are you standing there for? You still owe me a drink.	510002355	
25	Vera	"I'm curious, [PlayerName]. What do you think a drink called ""Vera"" would taste like?"	510002356	
26	[PlayerName]	You'll have to wait and see.		
27	Vera	Oh, and let's stop by that photo booth by the entrance later. The way you were eyeing it earlier—so obvious. It was hilarious.	510002357	
28	Vera	We've got plenty of time left. And you're not going anywhere until I'm fully satisfied, Commandant.	510002358	
29	Vera	Fiery and intense, always bringing me new surprises. That's the impression I have of you, [PlayerName].	510002347	
30	Vera	No matter what happens, you stay calm, like some stone statue in a university courtyard. This flavor fits you, doesn't it?	510002348	
31		Not to your liking?		
32		Want something to drink?		
33		Sure.		
34		I'll let you decide.		
35		Didn't know you could mix drinks.		
36		Surprise me.		
37		"How about something that tastes like ""Gray Raven Commandant""?"		
38		(Taste)		
39		And if this is another prank?		
40		I'm not drinking that.		
41		I still don't want to—		
42		It's got a kick.		
43		It's pretty mild.		
44		All in all, not bad. Thanks.		
45		So, Vera, what do you think of today's celebration?		
46		That bad, huh...		
47		You've got high standards.		
48		As long as you're satisfied.		
49		You scared me for a second...
