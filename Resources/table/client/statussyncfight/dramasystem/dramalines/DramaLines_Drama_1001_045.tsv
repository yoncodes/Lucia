14		A drink's base sets the tone—it's what gives the beverage its body. Whether it's crisp or mellow, smooth or intense, it all starts here. So, which ingredient will you choose as your base?		
15		Flavor is the soul of any drink. It transforms something simple into something special—whether sweet, tangy, refreshing, or tinged with subtle spice. So, how would you like to build on the base to enrich the flavor?		
16		Garnishing may be the last step, but it often defines the whole creation. A touch of fruit can brighten the taste, a hint of bitterness can balance the sweetness, and a subtle spice can bring out the aftertaste... So, what will you use to finish your drink?		
17	Lucia	Mine's finished too, Commandant. Here, please try it.	510000239
