1	Nervous Barista	Welcome to Kuroro Coffee, what can I—wait? Gray Raven Commandant!	510000198	
2	Lucia	Hello. We're here to try the interactive brewing experience.	510000199	
3	Calm Barista	Interactive experience... Oh thank goodness. I thought I'd have to brew coffee in front of the Gray Raven Commandant. What a relief...	510000200	
4	Calm Barista	Ahem—what I meant to say is, all the equipment is ready. Feel free to use anything you like.	510000201	
5	Lucia	Maybe... we could try making a clover pattern.	510000202	
6	Lucia	That'd be wonderful. I'll leave it to you then, Commandant.	510000203	
7		(The silky foam spreads across the coffee's surface. With a gentle turn of the wrist, the outline of a clover slowly appears, forming a perfect design.)		
8	Lucia	It's beautiful. Thank you, Commandant.	510000204	
9	Calm Barista	That's a work of art!	510000205	
10	Calm Barista	Sorry, I couldn't help myself after seeing something that perfect... Would you like to try some desserts? They just came out of the oven and are at their best right now. I can bring a few over.	510000206	
11	Lucia	No thanks. We heard Kowloong Restaurant has new dishes today. We're planning to try them out soon.	510000207	
12	Calm Barista	I've heard about those new dishes too, but if you're heading there now, the line's probably huge. A lot of our customers stopped here to kill time after grabbing a queue number over there.	510000208	
13	Lucia	It's that busy? In that case...	510000209	
14	[PlayerName]	When you mentioned the new dishes this morning, I went ahead and booked us a table.		
15	Lucia	I see. Good thinking, Commandant. Let's head over in a bit.	510000210	
16	Calm Barista	What a dependable partner... I've got to work hard too. I'll become a barista as reliable as the Gray Raven Commandant!	510000211	
17		Want me to show you how it's done?		
18		Let me help you.		
19		I've already made a reservation.
