1	[PlayerName]	"Where did things go wrong ""yesterday""? Galaxy Fashion? Kuroro Coffee? Or was it Stella Brew?"		
2	[PlayerName]	I remember back at Stella Brew, just before the end, Lucia said she hoped I'd confide in her if something was bothering me.		
3	[PlayerName]	But if she found out, her wish might unknowingly turn into a desire to help me, and it wouldn't be pure anymore.		
4	[PlayerName]	Am I supposed to fake it better? Fool her completely so she doesn't catch on?		
5	[PlayerName]	But if I do that... will her wish really come true?		
6	[PlayerName]	"A message from Lucia: ""Are you still resting?"""		
7		No. That's not what she would want at all.		
8		...I need to focus on fulfilling Lucia's true wish.
