1	Lucia	Commandant? I didn't expect you to be here so soon.		
2		Have you been waiting long, Lucia?		
3		Anywhere you'd like to check out today?		
4		Lucia, I should get going.		
5	Lucia	Not really, I just got here too. So... what's the plan for today, Commandant?		
6		The WGAA gave me some exhibition tickets. Want to go together?		
7	Lucia	Looks like we're on the same wavelength. Last time I passed by, I was thinking of inviting you to that same exhibition.		
8	Lucia	The exhibit's theme is... ancient murals and the digital reconstruction of surface cities.		
9	Lucia	Let's head out now. After the exhibition, I'd love to try the new dishes at Kowloong Restaurant with you, Commandant.		
10	Lucia	I heard Stella Brew launched a new electrolyte drink for Constructs. I'm thinking of giving it a try. What about you, Commandant? Any drink you'd like?		
11		You decide, Lucia.		
12	Lucia	Sounds good. I remember Stella Brew also has a wellness drink that's great. Since you're always so busy, why not go there for a drink and relax?		
13	Lucia	Heading out, Commandant? If anything happens, make sure to contact me.
