1	WGAA Staff Member	Commandant [PlayerName] and Captain Lucia of Gray Raven! Welcome!	510000023	
2	WGAA Staff Member	Oh! Are you two here to try out the Immersion Projector?	510000024	
3	WGAA Staff Member	The Immersion Projector simulates real sensory input, letting you step into the story and experience the adventure alongside the main character. It's going to be an unforgettable experience.	510000025	
4	WGAA Staff Member	Just a heads-up: the Golden Age films available today haven't been fully restored. Years of being lost caused some data to corrupt, and the plots are a bit jumbled. We're still working to separate the original content from the damage time has left behind.	510000026	
5	WGAA Staff Member	During playback, the device helps viewers fill in the gaps and reconstruct the storyline. That's what makes early access to these films possible.	510000027	
6	WGAA Staff Member	That also means the adventure you experience inside the film may not exactly match the original story.	510000028	
7	WGAA Staff Member	If you're set on seeing the original version, we can adjust the settings. With Lucia's computing power, we can fix the corrupted data in real time during playback.	510000029	
8	WGAA Staff Member	But the process is tedious and breaks the story's flow. It really hurts the immersion. I wouldn't recommend it.	510000030	
9	Lucia	"""Step into the story and experience the adventure alongside the main character""—that does sound interesting. Is that the device over there?"	510000031	
10	WGAA Staff Member	Ah, no, that's actually a different device still in development. It's called the Dreamweaver.	510000032	
11	WGAA Staff Member	Unlike the Immersion Projector, which plays someone else's story, the Dreamweaver recreates scenes from your own imagination. It helps build the perfect setting for you to craft your own romantic tale.	510000033	
12	WGAA Staff Member	It's still being refined, but it won't be long before the trial version is ready. If you're interested, feel free to visit again in a few days.	510000034	
13	WGAA Staff Member	As for the Immersion Projector, it's set up in the lounge next door. It's quiet there, so you won't be disturbed. Have you decided which film to experience? I can set it up for you.	510000035	
14	Lucia	"Thank you. Please set up ""Froggie's Day"" for us."	510000037	
15	WGAA Staff Member	"""Froggie's Day,"" certainly. This way, please."	510000036	
16	Lucia	Ready, Commandant?	510000038	
17	[PlayerName]	(Hand over the vouchers)		
18	[PlayerName]	So there's no way to experience the original version?		
19	[PlayerName]	Let's begin.
