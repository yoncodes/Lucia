1	Lucia	The fireworks, and this whole experience... are coming to a close.	510000376	
2	Lucia	Let's think about all that during our walk, Commandant.	510000377	
3	Lucia	Look, Commandant. There's a carving on this stone wall... is that a clover?	510000378	
4	Lucia	Maybe it's something else. Maybe we carved it together in a past loop.	510000379	
5	Lucia	You remember the recent loops, but... what if we've gone through even more of them before this?	510000380	
6	Lucia	We think this is only the third time, but maybe that's just because all the others were erased.	510000381	
7	Lucia	This time, you're the one who remembers. But next time, it could be me... or maybe neither of us will remember anything at all.	510000382	
8	Lucia	The one who keeps their memories might just be an unexpected variable. And this clover... it could be another variable, one among many.	510000383	
9	Lucia	Look, [PlayerName].	510000384	
10	Lucia	These footprints, for example—right now, we hope they'll stay behind, and guide us the next time around.	510000385	
11	Lucia	But if we see them again, will we still feel the same?	510000386	
12	Lucia	We might think they're just ordinary footprints. Or maybe just another sign that we're caught in a loop.	510000387	
13	Lucia	And we might not even be able to tell if they're guiding us forward, or just reminding us we're stuck. If that's the case...	510000388	
14	Lucia	Because... I couldn't bear it if you're the one who keeps seeing them over and over.	510000389	
15	Lucia	If we can't break the loop this time, and you're the only one who remembers each time after...	510000390	
16	Lucia	[PlayerName], I don't want these so-called shackles to hurt you. And I don't want to lose my way if my memories fade again.	510000391	
17	Lucia	If that happens, I won't be able to help you at all.	510000392	
18	[PlayerName]	What if I'm the one who forgets again and again... and you're the one who remembers, carrying it all alone each time?		
19	Lucia	Then I'll find you, every single time. As long as I'm with you, that's enough to keep me going.	510000393	
20	[PlayerName]	In that, I think we feel exactly the same.		
21	Lucia	As long as the person beside us stays the same, the feelings we share will leave a lasting mark.	510000394	
22	Lucia	Even if our memories fade, we'll never lose our way.	510000395	
23	Lucia	I understand now, Commandant. It's time for us to move on to the next place.	510000396	
24		About the loop, the wish, and what comes next...		
25		Hmm, another little surprise from the Dreamweaver?		
26		That would make things complicated.		
27		Why these gloomy thoughts all of a sudden?		
28		But what if it's the other way around?		
29		So even if those memories become shackles—		
30		We won't have to fear the pain they carry, right?
