1	Liv	All the qualified photos have been uploaded. Now we can select one to print and take with us.	510003069	
2	Lucia	Which one do you want, Commandant? Since you'll be keeping it, I think it's best if you choose.	510003070	
3	Liv	Lucia and I already talked about it. We want you to have this one, Commandant. It's a gift to remember today by.	510003071	
4	Lucia	It's from all of Gray Raven. Lee agrees too. I just checked with him. He wants you to keep it.	510003072	
5	[PlayerName]	Then I'll choose... this one.		
6	Liv	That's the end of the event. And looking at the time... we've been out for quite a while today.	510003073	
7	Lucia	If you're feeling tired, Commandant, Liv and I can head back to your lounge with you.	510003074	
8	Lucia	But if you still feel like exploring, we're happy to walk around the Commercial District with you a bit more.	510003075	
9	Lucia	There's no need to decide right away. You've still got some time off left, and Gray Raven will be with you every step of the way.	510003076
