1	Lucia	First is Aegina, a member of the Engineering Force. She was near the guild warehouse when the incident happened.	510002108	
2	Aegina	My name is Aegina.	510002111	
3	Aegina	Routine structural inspection.	510002109	
4	Lucia	Commandant, I confirmed with Karenina. Aegina's statement checks out. Merchants nearby also said she was doing inspections with them.	510002110	
5	[PlayerName]	...		
6	Aegina	...	510002112	
7	Aegina	Let me get back to work.	510002113	
8	Lucia	Next is Mr. Grey, manager of the Genius Board Game Shop. He was seen wandering near the warehouse at the time.	510002116	
9	Grey	Ah, the unstoppable Gray Raven Commandant, and the valiant Miss Lucia! An honor to meet you both. I am Grey Alfred, a humble traveler of the Commercial District.	510002119	
10	Grey	The human mind is like an ancient riverbed. At that moment, my river of inspiration had dried up. I wandered, pleading for the Muses to look my way.	510002117	
11	Lucia	"Mr. Grey was standing in front of the warehouse asking passersby for ""story inspiration."" The Commercial District's tip line confirms his story."	510002118	
12	Lucia	The third suspect is Jos, an employee of Mark Industries. She was spotted near the warehouse before the theft.	510002122	
13	Jos	I was talking to customers about shipment shares. You can go ask—	510002123	
14	Jos	Me? I don't remember that. Where exactly?	510002124	
15	Jos	Tch, just my rotten luck...!	510002125	
16	Lucia	Commandant, look out—!	510002126	
17	[PlayerName]	Lucia, flank her.		
18	Aegina	...	510002114	
19	Lucia	Commandant, based on statements from nearby merchants, Aegina had no time window to commit the crime.	510002115	
20	Grey	Oh! What a dramatic twist! I feel the darkness of the soul descending! The poet goes to jail while the villain walks free!	510002120	
21	Lucia	Commandant, Mr. Grey's behavior may be... eccentric, but multiple sources confirm he had no opportunity to commit the crime.	510002121
