1	Selena	...Conductor?		
2	Selena	Sequence Square is packed with people... What are the odds I'd bump into you here?		
3	Selena	I was just... watching the transport craft take off.		
4	Selena	Conductor, can you hear it? The voices carried away with them, coming from far away.		
5	Selena	Before departure, the transport craft carries soldiers' convictions, along with their families' prayers and wishes... those voices always echo in my heart.		
6	Selena	We don't realize how precious a moment is until it becomes a memory. I just hope they all got to say goodbye.		
7	Selena	...So every time I hear the craft engines roar, I can't help but wonder if the wind rushing past me carries with it some unspoken farewell.		
8	Selena	I hope they all return safely.		
9	Selena	So you knew too, Conductor... Yeah, I really do need to calm myself before the curtain rises.		
10	Selena	It's the same here. Even with people coming and going, listening to these everyday sounds helps ease the nerves and excitement before going on stage.		
11	Selena	The spotlight, the eyes of the audience, the expectations of my fellow performers... I need to turn all that into my drive to move forward.		
12	Selena	Thank you, Conductor. Hearing you say that calms me. I'll do my best to make this show a success.		
13	Selena	I'm collecting sounds. This place is quiet. Unlike the Astral Canopy, not many people come here, so it's better for finding inspiration.		
14	Selena	Yes, WGAA has been preparing a really interesting themed exhibition.		
15	Selena	We want to capture the sound textures of the city at different times and turn them into art.		
16	Selena	Like... the noise of the square right now, the whispers of lovers under the Astral Canopy, and... the voices we share between us.		
17	Selena	"These everyday sounds are really the heartbeat of Babylonia. We want to ""translate"" them into color. What do you think of the idea, Conductor?"		
18	Selena	"Of course, I'll save you a ticket. I can't wait to go with you and listen to those sounds that have been ""seen."""		
19	Selena	Goodbye, Conductor. We'll meet again.		
20		You looked so focused just now.		
21		I heard you have a show coming up. Are you getting ready for it?		
22		What are you working on, Selena?		
23		See you tomorrow, Selena.		
24		Voices from far away?		
25		Yeah. It will.		
26		I believe your performance will show your true feelings perfectly.		
27		Looking for inspiration? Is WGAA planning something new?		
28		That sounds interesting. Can I come see the exhibition?
