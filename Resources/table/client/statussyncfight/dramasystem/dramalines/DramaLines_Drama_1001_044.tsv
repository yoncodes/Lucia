1	Lucia	No need to go that far. I care more about capturing our moments as they are, not how perfect the pictures look.	510000449	
2	Lucia	Even when we're apart, we can still take little snapshots and add them in.	510000450	
3	Lucia	And even though we're not together at the time, when I see those photos, I'll feel like you're right there with me.	510000451	
4	Lucia	Yes. Looking back on them over time will feel like walking through all our shared memories again.	510000452	
5	[PlayerName]	Should we put the Dreamweaver photos at the beginning of the album?		
6	Lucia	The staff said those need a bit of processing first. Let's add them later.	510000453	
7	Lucia	But the album's already set up. We can't leave it empty. We should add something to it now.	510000454	
8	[PlayerName]	When we have time, let's visit the Dreamweaver and take some new photos.		
9	Lucia	Sure. As long as it's with you, I'm happy to.	510000455	
10	Lucia	No matter what kind of scenery awaits, I believe it'll make a perfect addition to our memories.	510000456	
11	Lucia	Let's go, Commandant. Our journey starts now, into our very own Dreamweaver world.	510000457	
12		Guess I need to learn how to look better on camera.		
13		Then maybe I should practice taking better photos?		
14		Kinda like a message board or a photo diary?		
15		The email said we were given one free trial pass. We can use it right away.		
16		Then shall we head out?
