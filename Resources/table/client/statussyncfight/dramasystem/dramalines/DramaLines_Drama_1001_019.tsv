1	Lucia	Only by bringing everyone's heartfelt wishes together could the Miracle Clover bloom... That's the message of the original ending.	510000305	
2	[PlayerName]	If we apply that same idea to what we're dealing with now...		
3	Lucia	You tried to follow Froggie's example, fulfilling my wish without telling me the truth, but we still couldn't break the loop.	510000306	
4	Lucia	Froggie faced the same situation in the film. But once the townspeople realized what they were going through and chose to help them, that's when the Miracle Clover finally sprouted...	510000307	
5	[PlayerName]	So you're saying that just fulfilling someone else's wish on your own, like Froggie did, won't be enough to break the time loop?		
6	Lucia	I've been thinking... maybe the only way we can grow our own Miracle Clover, our only way out, is if we fulfill our shared wish, together.	510000308	
7	[PlayerName]	It's possible. The way the movie ends really only seems to make sense if you interpret it that way.		
8	Lucia	A shared wish means something that comes from both of our hearts, and something we work toward together.	510000309	
9	Lucia	If it were up to me... I'd wish for a special memory. Just you and me. Something that belongs only to us.	510000310	
10	Lucia	A moment created from both our feelings, something no one else has. A memory that's truly ours.	510000311	
11	[PlayerName]	That sounds perfect. I think it's exactly what we're looking for.		
12	Lucia	Are you sure you don't want to think it over more? I mean, what if this isn't the right solution?	510000312	
13	Lucia	I'm prepared to face failure if I'm wrong. But if that choice ends up hurting you...	510000313	
14	Lucia	There's always risk in the unknown. I just don't want you to be the one who pays the price.	510000314	
15	[PlayerName]	But facing the unknown together—that's always been our unspoken promise, hasn't it?		
16	[PlayerName]	As long as it's a wish that truly comes from both our hearts, that's enough.		
17	Lucia	Alright, Commandant.	510000315	
18	Lucia	"""Sincere wishes bring about miracles""... that was the film's central message."	510000316	
19	Lucia	If we believe in that, and in each other, I know we'll find a miracle of our own.	510000317	
20	Lucia	This is a choice we're making together. Whatever comes of it, I'll face it with you.	510000318	
21	Lucia	No matter how this story ends.	510000319	
22	[PlayerName]	I noticed something earlier. It might be just what we need.		
23	[PlayerName]	Let's go try it now.		
24		"About this ""shared wish""—any thoughts, Lucia?"		
25		Then let's make that our goal and take the first step.		
26		Trust yourself, and trust us, Lucia.		
27	[PlayerName]	Then our next step is figuring out how to make that wish come true.
