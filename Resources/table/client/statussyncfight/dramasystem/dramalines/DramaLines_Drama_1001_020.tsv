1	Lucia	Commandant was talking about the public navigation point in Sequence Square.	510000320	
2	Lucia	Do you really think there's something here that can help us break the loop?	510000321	
3	Lucia	Dreamweaver—a special device jointly developed by the WGAA and the Science Council.	510000322	
4	Lucia	It takes keywords entered by the user and combines them with brainwave data to simulate the user's ideal world through digital modeling.	510000323	
5	Lucia	Oh! This is the one the staff member mentioned earlier.	510000324	
6	[PlayerName]	It can read keywords and create a world based on the user's wishes.		
7	Lucia	It sounds like it was made exactly for this kind of wish.	510000325	
8	WGAA Staff Member	Commandant [PlayerName] and Captain Lucia of Gray Raven! Welcome! Are you interested in trying out our Dreamweaver device?	510000326	
9	WGAA Staff Member	The device hasn't officially launched yet, but if you'd like, you can fill out a reservation form and we'll notify you as soon as it's ready.	510000327	
10	Lucia	Is there any way we could request early access? Please, this is very important to us.	510000328	
11	WGAA Staff Member	Well, since it's the two of you... I'll see what I can do.	510000329	
12	Lucia	Thank you. We appreciate it.	510000330	
13	WGAA Staff Member	Good news. The developers have agreed to let you try it early, as long as you're willing to authorize the use of your session data to help optimize the system.	510000331	
14	Lucia	No issues on my side.	510000332	
15	WGAA Staff Member	Then I'll need you both to sign this authorization form and a non-disclosure agreement.	510000333	
16	WGAA Staff Member	Before the system is released publicly, all related data must remain confidential. We ask that you run your test in a private setting.	510000334	
17	[PlayerName]	Understood. We've signed both forms.		
18	WGAA Staff Member	Thank you for your cooperation. I'll bring you the device and set up your access right away.	510000335	
19	Lucia	We've got the Dreamweaver. Now for the private setting... Commandant? Do you have any ideas?	510000336	
20	Lucia	Right, no time to waste. Let's go.	510000337	
21		I noticed this device here earlier.		
22		We'd really appreciate your help making that happen.		
23		I'm fine with that. What about you, Lucia?		
24		All things considered, our lounge is probably the best choice.
