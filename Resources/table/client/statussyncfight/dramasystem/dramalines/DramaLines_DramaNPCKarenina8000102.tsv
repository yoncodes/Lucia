1	Karenina	Hey, [PlayerName], you're here hanging out too?		
2	Karenina	What do you think of this square? Pretty nice, right? I designed it.		
3	Karenina	Hmph, at least you have some taste.		
4	Karenina	Getting this approved by those folks on the Commercial Council was a nightmare! I had to revise the design over and over again, and I almost went nuts!		
5	Karenina	But seeing how well it turned out in the end, I suppose I can let all that frustration slide.		
6	Karenina	Mostly because we were stuck in this endless discussion with those folks on the review committee.		
7	Karenina	In my original blueprint, I had hidden automatic turrets installed under this fountain, behind that billboard over there, and on top of the clock tower!		
8	Karenina	"And guess what! They said it was ""excessive militarization"" and ""not appropriate for the Commercial District""... and they rejected my proposal COMPLETELY! Can you believe that?!"		
9	Karenina	Full firepower coverage is absolutely essential for site security! What a waste of my brilliant idea.		
10	Karenina	Livelier? You can count on it!		
11	Karenina	A square designed by me, lacking appeal? Just wait and see. This place will be packed to the brim in no time!		
12	Karenina	Huh? Leaving already...? Ahem, I-I mean, go ahead and do what you need to do!		
13	Karenina	If you have time after you're done... um... feel free to come back. Nothing special! Just... thought you might want to learn more about the square's details!		
14		Amazing design!		
15		I heard the Engineering Force spent quite a long time on its construction?		
16		This place will be even livelier in the future.		
17		I should go now.
