1	Lucia	I already reported the issue before you woke up. The producers from the WGAA promised to compensate us properly.	510000441	
2	Lucia	Yes, it's good to be back.	510000440	
3	Lucia	No more origami clovers, and no more ending up in strange places either.	510000433	
4	[PlayerName]	The terminal shows it's the next day, so the loop must be over, right?		
5	Lucia	Yes. So for now, just rest, Commandant. You're safe.	510000434	
6	[PlayerName]	With you here, I already feel more relaxed. I think I'll be fine.		
7	Lucia	Then take your time to rest.	510000435	
8	Terminal	Ding! File sent. Please check your inbox. Reminder: the Dreamweaver data storage is time-limited.	510000436	
9	Lucia	When I woke up, I saw that we were both still wearing the Dreamweaver.	510000437	
10	Lucia	Something must've gone wrong while we were using it together. Our consciousness got trapped inside.	510000438	
11	Lucia	But it's alright now. We're both back in the real world, Commandant.	510000439	
12	Terminal	Please finish selecting your photos and submit your feedback within the required time for final processing...	510000442	
13	Lucia	That's from the staff. They checked in before you woke up and offered to print the photos we took in the Dreamweaver world... as a gift for helping with their test.	510000443	
14	Lucia	They suggested it while retrieving the device. It's been upgraded—it can now read and digitize memories directly from the brain.	510000444	
15	Lucia	They also promised this kind of malfunction won't happen again.	510000445	
16	Lucia	And they offered to digitize the memory of this whole experience for us, free of charge.	510000446	
17	[PlayerName]	We've selected quite a few. Let's make a shared album and put them all in there.		
18	Lucia	Yes. We can take more photos in our daily lives too, and keep them all in that album.	510000447	
19	Lucia	That way, we'll have a Dreamweaver world of our own.	510000448	
20		Good thing I'm still on vacation today.		
21		"So, what exactly was that ""time loop"" all about?"		
22		Glad we made it back.		
23		I'm filing a complaint!		
24		Well, at least we got something out of it.		
25		A pleasant surprise, huh?		
26		Then let's start picking the photos?
