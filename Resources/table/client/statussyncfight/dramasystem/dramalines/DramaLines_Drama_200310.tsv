1	Billy	Y'all be the judge! Look at that cup! That was cat hair inside, wasn't it?	520005053	
2	Ed	Sir, is there something I can help you with?	520005054	
3	Billy	If I'd swallowed that, I could've gotten some weird disease! Who's gonna take responsibility?	520005055	
4	Ed	I-I'm very sorry... We'll remake your drink, and your whole order will be on the house...	520005056	
5	Customer A	A free drink won't help if someone gets sick! You're gonna pay for the hospital bills too?	520005057	
6	Customer B	Yeah! This is completely unacceptable!	520005058	
7	Ed	...	520005059	
8	Billy	This is a food safety issue. You'd better give me a proper explanation.	520005060	
9	Haley	Exactly. The security footage can prove it.	520005061	
10	Billy	(Tsk, guess I'll have to back off for now.)	520005062	
11	Ed	S-should we show the footage to the customer...?	520005063	
12	Billy	No, no, no! Just a misunderstanding! I've got things to do. Gotta go!	520005064	
13	Haley	[PlayerName], I've already sent the last hour of security footage to your terminal.	520005065	
14	Billy	S-stop teasing me! I really do have urgent business!	520005066	
15	Billy	This must be some kind of misunderstanding. I'll be going now. Bye!	520005067	
16	Haley	These types always act tough until they're exposed.	520005068	
17	Ed	Oh right... Manager [PlayerName], Jason said he wants to talk to you.	520005069	
18	Ed	Got it.	520005070	
19		I'll take it from here.		
20		If there's a problem, you can talk to me.		
21		Our cafe follows strict hygiene protocols.		
22		There are no cats allowed anywhere near the kitchen.		
23		Want to see how great you look on camera?		
24		Carrying cat hair into a cafe—pretty suspicious.		
25		I'll leave the cleanup to you, then.		
26		Alright. Stay calm next time something like this happens.
