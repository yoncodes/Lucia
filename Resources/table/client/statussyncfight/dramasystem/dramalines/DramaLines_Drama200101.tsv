1	Celica (In Call)	Comms received—[PlayerName], what a coincidence. I was thinking about contacting you and sending you a notification.	510002000	
2	Celica (In Call)	Since you called first, why don't you go ahead? What did you need from me?	510002001	
3	Celica (In Call)	The Flourish Guild, Kurono... This is a serious disruption to market order. I'll notify the appropriate departments right away so they can investigate before it jeopardizes the square's development.	510002002	
4	Celica (In Call)	You know what? I've got some news for you, and it's also about the Commercial Square.	510002003	
5	Celica (In Call)	After a joint meeting between several departments, BCC has decided to appoint you as Chief Commissioner of the Commercial Square, giving you full authority to lead the project.	510002004	
6	Celica (In Call)	Putting the Task Force in charge of the square's development was a decision made after carefully weighing all sides.	510002005	
7	Celica (In Call)	Your performance during previous Task Force operations has stood out time and again, so this role naturally falls to you.	510002006	
8	[PlayerName]	What does a Commissioner actually do?		
9	Celica (In Call)	Coordinating resources, planning commercial activity, maintaining market order—these should all be second nature to you by now, right?	510002007	
10	Celica (In Call)	One thing to watch for—if your hunch is right, the Flourish Guild may try to interfere with your work. Until the official investigation wraps up, try not to escalate things with them.	510002008	
11	Celica (In Call)	The BCC will be holding a formal inauguration soon. Before that, I suggest visiting the square yourself to see if you can uncover any new signs of interference by the Flourish Guild.	510002009	
12	Celica (In Call)	As for the finer details of the job, I'll update you after the ceremony. The square is in your hands now, Chief Commissioner!	510002010	
13		Understood.		
14		That came out of nowhere.
