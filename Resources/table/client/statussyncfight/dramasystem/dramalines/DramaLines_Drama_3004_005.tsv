1	Psychologist	I've tried to avoid anything that would stir up Rhea's painful memories, so I told her story from an outsider's perspective. That's how these tales came about.		
2	Psychologist	This allows her to maintain a certain emotional distance while recalling memories, avoiding direct psychological impact.		
3	Psychologist	Like I said, to get her treatment started right, it's best if you handle the follow-up—she'll feel more comfortable talking to a comrade.		
4	Psychologist	[PlayerName], now please hand these items to her.		
5	Psychologist	Thank you very much. Also, I suggest you show her those two items first and watch her reaction.		
6	Psychologist	If her condition is stable, then you can show her these stories.		
7		You can count on me.		
8		Got it.
