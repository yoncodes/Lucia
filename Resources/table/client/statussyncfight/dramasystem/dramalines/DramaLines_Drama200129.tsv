1	Hertha	W-what? How did you even find this place?	510002241	
2	Vera	Leave a bloody trail in the wasteland, and the wolves will always come knocking, Councilwoman.	510002242	
3	Hertha	You're... C-Cerberus?!	510002243	
4	Vera	Sabotaging development plans, attacking public officials, tampering with the network... Any one of those is enough to bring your pathetic family down for good.	510002244	
5	Vera	And on top of that, you dared interfere with the Gray Raven Commandant on official duty... Your ancestors must be weeping.	510002245	
6	Hertha	Do you have any idea who's backing me? No... Stay away!	510002246	
7	Vera	I couldn't care less which rats are covering for you—	510002247	
8	Vera	Because sooner or later, I'll drag them out one by one. They can take turns introducing themselves when the time comes.	510002248	
9	Hertha	No—!	510002249	
10	???	Hertha, you're finally paying the price for your stupidity.	510002250	
11	Hertha	M-Mister Mark?! Please help me...!	510002251	
12	Vera	Oh? The big fish was so eager to meet his end that he delivered himself right to our doorstep?	510002252	
13	Mark	A pleasure to meet you, Gray Raven Commandant, Vera. I'm truly grateful for all you've done to restore order in the Commercial District.	510002253	
14	Vera	Cut the small talk. You're the one who's secretly working with Kurono and directing this lot to sabotage the development.	510002254	
15	Mark	I believe there's been a misunderstanding. Hertha has had no connection to the Flourish Guild for some time now.	510002255	
16	Mark	As the head of market expansion, Hertha Buchanan abused her position to form cliques and line her own pockets, in clear violation of the guild's core regulations.	510002256	
17	Mark	In fact, the board voted to terminate her and blacklist her permanently even before Your Excellency was appointed Commissioner.	510002257	
18	Mark	In other words, all her actions were personal. They have nothing to do with the Flourish Guild.	510002258	
19	Vera	Classic. Sacrificing the pawn to save the king. Looks like your master's already cut you loose, Hertha.	510002259	
20	Mark	I'm afraid I have no idea what you're talking about. I have another meeting shortly, so I'll have to end this conversation here.	510002260	
21	Mark	Hertha, as your former superior, let me offer some advice: cooperate fully with the commandant's investigation. The guild will ensure the Buchanan family is looked after.	510002261	
22	Hertha	...	510002262	
23	Mark	Now then, if you'll excuse me, I'll take my leave—	510002263	
24	Vera	Go ahead and run. Just remember, no matter where you hide, I'll always catch up with you.	510002264	
25	Vera	You'd better book a ticket out of Babylonia while you still can, before I make your worthless underlings spill everything.	510002265	
26	Vera	I'm looking forward to seeing just how long those old bones of yours can hold out at the tip of my lance.	510002266	
27	Mark	...	510002267	
28	Vera	[PlayerName], we've got who we came for. Let's take them in.	510002268	
29		The chairman of the Flourish Guild?		
30		We've already uncovered evidence of the guild's illegal activities.		
31		It's all been submitted. You won't be able to run for long.
