1	Lee	The connection's acting up here? ...Hm? Oh, Commandant.		
2	Lee	I noticed this Kurepair behaving oddly, so I stopped it for a quick check-up.		
3	Lee	Kurepair units are supposed to maintain other mechanoids. Looks like the Engineering Force forgot to give them self-diagnostic modules.		
4	Lee	I've written new logic circuits. That should fix the issue.		
5	Lee	We should. Commandant, can you reach out to the Engineering Force for me?		
6	Lee	Once this unit's repaired, I'll run safety tests. If it passes, I'll share the new logic with the Engineering Force so they can update the self-check firmware on all Kurepairs.		
7	Lee	Thanks, Commandant. I'll take it from here.		
8	Lee	Perfect timing, Commandant. Can you log this set of data for me?		
9	Lee	This one used to be a Kuroro cleaning bot. It shows strange behavior during operation, but its logs insist everything's fine...		
10	Lee	Strange. Your data shows nothing unusual either. Yet compared to the others, its actions are clearly off.		
11	Lee	You're right. Then it must be mechanical. Let me take a closer look.		
12	Lee	Lee deftly removes the Kurepair's casing and inspects its inner mechanisms.		
13	Lee	Just as I thought, this Kurepair spent years doing household cleaning. Some of its parts are badly worn.		
14	Lee	They slapped maintenance-type Kuroro logic onto it, which caused operational errors.		
15	Lee	All we need now is to swap out these worn parts. Nice teamwork! Thanks for the help, Commandant.		
16	Lee	Alright, you can go handle your duties. I'll see you later.		
17		What are you doing?		
18		Do you need a hand?		
19		I've got something to discuss, but I'll come find you later.		
20		Should we run checks on the other Kuroros too?		
21		Sure thing.		
22		Recorded data? What are you working on, Lee?		
23		You mean the data I logged?		
24		Maybe the issue isn't in the logic circuits?		
25		Looks like we've found the root of the problem.
