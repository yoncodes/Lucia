7	Verus	Because of my unauthorized modifications to Kuroro, Tris has become suspicious of me, and she's even been punished because of it.		
8	Verus	If I keep hiding the truth, who knows what other problems might arise.		
9	[PlayerName]	If it was me, I would face up to it.		
10	Verus	Is that so?		
11	[PlayerName]	I won't run away from my responsibilities.		
12	Verus	Alright, I know what I need to do now. Thank you.		
13	Verus	Ah, I did actually enroll in that pilot training course for active personnel offered by the Science Council.		
14	Verus	"In that ""Intelligent Machine Theory and Wartime Multi-Dimensional Practical Exercises (Beginner)"" course, I was the only student who passed!"		
15	Verus	I'm not lying.		
16	Verus	My skill level only allows me to make minor tweaks that wouldn't do any real harm.		
17		You should report yourself to the Science Council, kiddo.		
18		Your guilty-sounding tone is pretty suspicious.
