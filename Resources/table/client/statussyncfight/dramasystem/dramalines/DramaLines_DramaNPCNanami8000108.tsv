1	Nanami	Commandant! Look what I found. It's an arcade!		
2		Uh... that's actually a simulation training facility.		
3		Yeah. Haven't you tried it yet, Nanami?		
4		Nanami? What are you doing here in Babylonia?		
5		...I just remembered, I still have missions to do.		
6	Nanami	But it totally looks like a game! Look, there's platform jumping and shooting sims... What else could it be?		
7	Nanami	Wait, don't tell me... it's Babylonia's secret special ops course? So fun! I want to try too!		
8	Nanami	Oh right! You're F.O.S.'s top graduate, Commandant. You must be amazing at special ops!		
9	Nanami	Com-man-dant... Teach Nanami how to play!		
10	Nanami	I want to play with you... Whoa! That score is so high. Commandant, was that your record?		
11		Yeah. Do you want to hear some tips for the game?		
12	Nanami	No! Even if I got a high score like that, the credit would be yours. I want to figure out the winning formula myself!		
13		On her first try, Nanami scores incredibly high, but it still isn't enough. The Gray Raven Commandant's record stays at the top.		
14	Nanami	Ugh, so close... One more round! I'm going to beat your high score this time!		
15	Nanami	Bet you didn't expect this! I came here just to play with you, Commandant!		
16		But wait, how did you even get in here?		
17	Nanami	Secret! I'm not telling you. And besides...		
18	Nanami	And you never told me that Babylonia's Commercial District has so many fun places hidden in it.		
19	Nanami	Besides this arcade, I saw a whole bunch of people over that way. Looks like they're having a lot of fun. Commandant, what's that place?		
20		Want to go check it out together?		
21	Nanami	Yay! With you here, Commandant, anywhere is fun!		
22	Nanami	Huh? Are you leaving already, Commandant? I want to play more with you.
