1	Pollack	...What should I do?		
2	[PlayerName]	Were you lost in thought just now?		
3	Pollack	Yes, I've been developing a new drink lately, but I'm stuck on choosing the base flavor. Should it be sweet, or would salty work better?		
4	Pollack	I see... I trust you. The new drink will be out soon, so please make sure to come try it.		
5		Sweet, of course.		
6		Salty, of course.		
7	Pollack	Ah, Gray Raven Commandant, you're here. I'm so sorry about this.
