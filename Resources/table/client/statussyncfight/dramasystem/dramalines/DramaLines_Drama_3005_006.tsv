4	Staff Member	Thank you very much for your assistance, Gray Raven Commandant. We truly appreciate your hard work.		
5	Staff Member	The issue with these Kuroro units isn't too serious. They're mainly acting on their own and out of control because they're missing their behavior constraint modules.		
6	Staff Member	We'll install and calibrate these modules for them. The Kuroro units will be operating normally soon.		
7	Staff Member	The repair process is quite fast. I'm sure you'll see them active on the streets very soon.		
8	Staff Member	If there's nothing else, I'll take them back now. Thank you again for your assistance.
