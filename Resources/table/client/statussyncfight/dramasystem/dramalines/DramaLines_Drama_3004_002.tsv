1	Rhea	Hello... Are you the Gray Raven Commandant? I've seen your speeches, and Ross always talks about you... I never thought I'd run into you here.		
2	[PlayerName]	Ross has told me about you. He said you like to take walks around Sequence Square, so I thought I'd come over and say hello.		
3	[PlayerName]	Were you watching the projection in the center of the square? The light shows are very unique. I always stop and watch when I pass by.		
4	Rhea	The light display is beautiful, but... the Astral Canopy... I feel like I've seen it somewhere before. I just can't remember where, no matter how hard I try...		
5	Rhea	I'm sorry...		
6	[PlayerName]	It's okay, don't worry about it.		
7	Rhea	Thank you... Actually, I feel like I'm running away from something. I shouldn't have forgotten those things... I should remember them...		
8	Rhea	The doctor says I shouldn't force myself, but... I can't forget. I must remember. I must remember... everyone...		
9	Rhea	I'm sorry for acting weird earlier... But I'm fine now, really. Thank you. I rarely get the chance to talk, or rather, I don't know who I can talk to about this...		
10	Rhea	Talking with you has helped me relax quite a bit, but this was all rather sudden... I need some time alone to collect my thoughts. If there's a chance later, I'd like to chat with you again. Would that be alright?		
11	[PlayerName]	Of course. I'll leave you be for now.		
12	Rhea	Thank you... Thank you so much.		
13		Hi.		
14		Rhea?
