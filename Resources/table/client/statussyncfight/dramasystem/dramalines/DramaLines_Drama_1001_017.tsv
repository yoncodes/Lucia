1	Lucia	Commandant.	510000251	
2	Lucia	In your earlier message, you mentioned there was something you wanted to tell me. What happened?	510000252	
3	Lucia	A time loop...	510000253	
4	[PlayerName]	I know it sounds unbelievable, but it really happened over the past few days. These clovers are the proof.		
5		Lucia looks at the near-identical clovers in your hands. At first, she seems surprised, but then quickly regains her composure.		
6	[PlayerName]	Of course, this might not be enough to convince you. I can try predicting what'll happen next, like...		
7	Lucia	There's no need for that, Commandant. You don't have to prove anything. Even without those clovers, I'd believe you.	510000254	
8	Lucia	"From what you've described, these recurring dreams seem to be connected to the movie ""Froggie's Day"" somehow."	510000255	
9	Lucia	You followed and recreated events from the story, yet never achieved the original ending.	510000256	
10	Lucia	Maybe we don't have the full story. I remember you said that what we experienced through the Immersion Projector was different from the film's original plot.	510000257	
11	Lucia	That could be the key. Before we make any moves, let's figure out the original story. There might be a clue hidden in it.	510000258	
12		Then let's head to the cinema.		
13		(Show her the clovers)		
14		That's right.
