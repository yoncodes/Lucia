1	Psychologist	Hello, [PlayerName]. I'm Rhea's psychologist.		
2	Psychologist	To be honest, when Ross told me he'd asked for the Gray Raven Commandant's help, I thought I'd misheard him... But regardless, thank you so much for offering your assistance.		
3	Psychologist	Rhea seems to have forgotten many of her memories of Earth, likely as a defense mechanism. Now that she's gradually becoming more stable, I'd like to help her recover those memories.		
4	Psychologist	The first step of therapy is crucial, as it directly impacts the effectiveness of the treatment. However, Rhea has consistently struggled to open up to me, which may prevent us from successfully taking that critical first step.		
5	Psychologist	Shared identities can create a sense of connection. That's why I'm hoping that during the initial phase of treatment, you could communicate with Rhea as a fellow soldier, helping her recover her memories.		
6	Psychologist	Of course, this only works if Rhea actually feels more at ease around you. Why don't you start by having a casual conversation with her and see how comfortable she is with you?		
7	Psychologist	Thank you for understanding. Rhea prefers crowded places. Busy environments help her feel secure. She should be around Sequence Square right now.		
8	Psychologist	I'll send you her photo in a bit. I'm counting on you.		
9		What do you need me to do?		
10		Got it.
