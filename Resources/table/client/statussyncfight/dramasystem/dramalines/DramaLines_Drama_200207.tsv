1	Layden	Sorry, sorry! Please wait just a bit longer! It's been a busy day today, and I have no idea where our boss put the souvenirs...	510003048	
2	[PlayerName]	Or is Ross not in the shop today?		
3	Layden	Huh? You didn't know? I thought you two were close, so I figured he would've already asked you for help or something.	510003049	
4	Layden	Well... I can't say for sure, but we're all pretty sure something's been bothering him. Something serious.	510003050	
5	Lucia	Something serious? How bad is it?	510003051	
6	Layden	We don't know exactly. He won't talk about it, but it's clearly related to the shop.	510003052	
7	Layden	One time, I saw him looking really worried. I think I even heard him muttering about what to do with the future of Kuroro Coffee...	510003053	
8	Layden	Anyway, it's hard to explain all at once. But lately, he's been in a bad state. Looks like he hasn't slept in days.	510003054	
9	[PlayerName]	If there's anything I can help with, I'll do what I can.		
10	Layden	Really? That would be amazing, thank you so much!	510003055	
11	Layden	The manager's always been good to all of us. We hate seeing him like this...	510003056	
12	Layden	Once today's rush is over, feel free to come to me or Haley if you need anything. We want to help too.	510003057	
13	Layden	Ah, so they were shoved way in the back. No wonder I couldn't find them.	510003058	
14	Layden	Whew... got them. Here you go, [PlayerName].	510003059	
15	Layden	The rewards for the event and the check-in task will be mailed to you later. But for now, you can take printed copies of your check-in photos with you.	510003060	
16	Layden	It's a special bonus we've prepared for you. Please accept them.	510003061	
17	Lucia	Now that we've got the souvenirs, let's get ready to go, Commandant.	510003062	
18		Why not ask him directly?		
19		Help? Did something happen to Mr. Ross?		
20		He hasn't contacted me lately.		
21		Don't worry. I'll talk to him and see what's going on.		
22		Thanks. I will.		
23		Thank you very much.
