1	Aniela	Ah, Gray Raven Commandant.		
2	[PlayerName]	You're staring at the globe?		
3	Aniela	Hmm... I was just thinking that, given the current battle situation, my parents' hometown should be liberated soon.		
4	Aniela	Though I've never set foot on that land, I've seen it countless times in my dreams, calling to me to witness its wonders.

6	[PlayerName]	I'm sure you will.
