1	Celica (In Call)	[PlayerName], BCC has arranged your inauguration ceremony. All the vendors from the Commercial Square will participate then.	510002022	
2	Celica (In Call)	I've already reported everything I know about the Flourish Guild. Have you found anything new on your end?	510002023	
3	[PlayerName]	I came across a printed list. Looks like it names all the businesses they're targeting.		
4	Celica (In Call)	A list? Can I have a look?	510002024	
5	Celica (In Call)	...We can't say for sure it's from the guild, but if we investigate, we might still dig up some useful leads.	510002025	
6	Celica (In Call)	I'll forward it to the proper authorities right away. Great work, [PlayerName].	510002026	
7	Celica (In Call)	Until the investigation wraps up, you're still in charge of keeping order at the square. It's a critical stage. Any problems now could be a disaster.	510002029	
8	Celica (In Call)	I was just thinking... One business alone might not be able to stand up to the guild. But what if we unite them all?	510002030	
9	Celica (In Call)	I have an idea that might stop the Flourish Guild from expanding illegally. Want to hear it, [PlayerName]?	510002031	
10	Celica (In Call)	The ceremony's about to begin. Let me know when you're ready.	510002032	
11	Celica (In Call)	They might be backed by a power like Kurono.	510002027	
12	Celica (In Call)	It's a tough situation, but this is your moment to shine as Chief Commissioner.	510002028	
13		The Flourish Guild went too far.		
14		Thrown right into the fire, huh.		
15		Leave it to me.		
16		I'll do my best...
