1	Lucia	Commandant, I scanned the warehouse. Only one crate was tampered with.	510002093	
2	[PlayerName]	The crate is full of spice containers. Some were broken, and spices are scattered all over.		
3	Lucia	Judging by the cuts, the tool used was sharp and had a wide blade—strong enough to pierce the alloy material.	510002094	
4	Lucia	The spices show signs of being burned by intense heat, but not evenly. Looks like the cutting tool also had a basic heating module.	510002095	
5	Lucia	That would mean the thief used...	510002096	
6	Lucia	That's right. From what I can tell, the weapon was probably military-grade.	510002097	
7	Lucia	Also, the staff at Ocean Heart's flagship store are all mechanoids. Their laser tools don't match the results we're seeing.	510002100	
8	[PlayerName]	Since there are no other leads, let's narrow it down to humans and Constructs. We can check if anyone fits the profile.		
9	Lucia	Right. Surveillance was jammed during the theft, but we can pull footage from nearby and track movement.	510002101	
10	Lucia	Understood, Commandant.	510002102	
11	Lucia	But a laser gun wouldn't make such a clean cut.	510002098	
12	Lucia	...Ultrasonic? Based on my experience, sonic weapons can't cut through metal.	510002099	
13		(Examine supply crate)		
14		A long blade.		
15		A laser gun.		
16		Ultrasonic weapon.		
17		Let's do that.
