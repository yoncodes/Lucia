1	Vera	"Oh? So you really were looking forward to our little ""date""!"	510002323	
2	Vera	Still playing it cool? Maybe I should've made you wait even longer.	510002324	
3	Vera	You look like you're in a hurry. Looking for someone, Commandant?	510002321	
4	Vera	Tell me, was there a moment you thought I'd stand you up? Leave you here all alone in the cold?	510002322	
5	Vera	I've got to admit, the square's actually looking decent. Lots of grinning fools around. You've got a real talent for keeping them entertained.	510002325	
6	Vera	But my standards are just a little bit higher than theirs.	510002326	
7	Vera	I've been very busy lately. Had to turn down a good number of beatdowns and arrests just to make time for this.	510002327	
8	Vera	"I've been looking forward to this celebration. If it doesn't impress me, I'm afraid I'll have to give you a little ""punishment."""	510002328	
9	Vera	Hmm... Aren't you greedy.	510002329	
10	Vera	Alright, if today's celebration meets my expectations, I'll give you a proper reward.	510002330	
11	Vera	Then show me—what brilliant idea does the famous Gray Raven Commandant have to entertain me?	510002331	
12		Vera...		
13		I'm looking for you.		
14		Yes.		
15		No.		
16		Meaning...?		
17		"""Just a little bit""?"		
18		If there's punishment, does that mean there's a reward too?		
19		Let's go then.		
20		I'm confident you'll like it.
