1	Vera	Kurono's operation at the square has been completely wiped out. No one will be interfering with your development plans anymore.	510002269	
2	[PlayerName]	Thanks for your help, Vera.		
3	[PlayerName]	Glad you were here.		
4	Vera	Oh please. Even without me, those little bottom-feeders wouldn't have caused much trouble.	510002270	
5	[PlayerName]	What will you do next?		
6	Vera	Flourish isn't finished yet. The mission goes on. I'll pry open Hertha's little clique and use them to bait something bigger.	510002271	
7	Vera	"But before that, remember the ""dinner"" I mentioned earlier? We wrapped up the investigation even faster than I expected."	510002272	
8	[PlayerName]	Are you asking me to dinner?		
9	Vera	What, are you going to turn me down?	510002273	
10	[PlayerName]	Maybe a little...		
11	Vera	...	510002274	
12	[PlayerName]	Just kidding.		
13	Vera	Let's go, then. There's a restaurant nearby with decent food.	510002275	
14	[PlayerName]	Oh, right, Vera.		
15	Vera	Hmm?	510002276	
16	[PlayerName]	Here's a voucher for the square attractions. Take it.		
17	[PlayerName]	When the square is completed, be sure to come check it out.		
18	Vera	Alright. I'm curious to see what you'll actually make of this half-finished dump.	510002277	
19	Vera	I hope you won't let me down, Commandant!	510002278
