1	Zhu Xin	[PlayerName], have you walked through the green area?		
2	Zhu Xin	I heard they've been offering guided tours about rare plants there.		
3	[PlayerName]	I don't know. Are you interested in plants?		
4	Zhu Xin	I've always found them incredibly resilient. Seeing them so full of life makes me feel like I need to work hard, too.		
5	Zhu Xin	You'll definitely come to like them.		
6	Zhu Xin	I found a particularly beautiful orchid in the combat records not long ago. It's probably a Calanthe orchid from the Golden Age.		
7	Zhu Xin	It's so beautiful... When I think about how humans once lived with such magnificent life forms, it feels like something out of a dream.		
8	[PlayerName]	Those days will surely come again.		
9		I'll keep an eye out for them next time I'm on the surface.
