1	Tris	Hello, how may I help you?		
2	[PlayerName]	You don't... look like office staff.		
3	Tris	I'm currently being punished for getting into a fight. Just three days of community service, that's all...		
4	[PlayerName]	A fight?		
5	Tris	I'm already properly reflecting on my actions while serving my punishment.		
6	Tris	Besides, front desk duty? What kind of punishment is that supposed to be...		
7	Tris	"They said I have ""interpersonal issues"" and only know how to solve problems with my fists, so I need to develop my communication skills."		
8	Tris	What's wrong with MY communication? That jerk is the one with the problem!		
9	Tris	It wasn't the first time either! Multiple times! I caught that creep secretly following Kuroro around.		
10	Tris	It looked suspicious, no matter how you slice it! I was just looking out for Babylonia's security.		
11	Tris	And the result? Another disciplinary notice.		
12	[PlayerName]	That's how I see you, at least. I believe more people will come to discover this side of you, eventually.		
13	Tris	Mmm... Thank you. I feel much better now.		
14		I'm sure you'll do well at the front desk, too.		
15		Being attentive and vigilant is your strength.
