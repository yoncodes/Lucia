1	Nataman	Oh no, he definitely found out!		
2	Gray Boots	I knew it. You can't hide something like this.		
3	Haina	Although it started as research into communication and social interaction methods, we ended up getting along really well... His way of expressing himself is a bit unique, but he's actually a very caring friend.		
4	Gray Boots	"And that book... I mean, your ""theoretical findings,"" has been selling really well."		
5	Nataman	Stop it with the snide remarks.		
6	Gray Boots	So, are you going to write more books? It's really profitable...		
7	Nataman	...Be quiet for a moment.		
8	Nataman	Should we just stop for now? Kuroro's malfunction could be fixed at any moment, and exploiting these bugs isn't a long-term solution.		
9	Haina	"But I promised Lily I'd teach her how to apologize to the professor after the mission. It would be a shame to give up now... She sees the professor as a mother figure and is trying so hard to interact with her ""mom"" like a normal child would. I have to help her."		
10	Gray Boots	"Can that little Construct really learn that? Even the author themselves is having a complete meltdown over ""apologizing""..."		
11	Nataman	No matter what, Haina, you need to go apologize right away. Gray Boots, see what you can find out about getting an official publishing number. If we can get approved, we won't have to sell under the table anymore. As for Lily, I'm sure everything will be fine, because mothers... well, they always forgive their children.
