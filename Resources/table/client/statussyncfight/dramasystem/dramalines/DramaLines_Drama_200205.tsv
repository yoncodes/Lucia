1	Event Staff	All your information has been verified. Everything's in order. You're now cleared to participate in the event.	510003017	
2	Event Staff	Your electronic invitation has been sent to your terminal. Please use it to enter. We hope you enjoy the experience.	510003018	
3	Lucia	Thank you. The invitation mentioned a location at the end without providing any details. May I ask what it means...?	510003019	
4	Event Staff	That location is for a hidden challenge in the event. If you complete it, there's an extra reward waiting for you.	510003020	
5	Lucia	A reward... Commandant, should we give it to Lee as a gift?	510003021	
6	Vera	Hah. So this is how [PlayerName] spends a vacation? Lounging around in places like this? How carefree of you.	510003022	
7	Vera	Kuroro Coffee... You've actually reminded me. It's a nice place when you need a break from the noise.	510003023	
8	Vera	"Didn't you see the crowd swarming the front of Kowloong Restaurant when you arrived? That was all thanks to two of my team's ""geniuses."""	510003024	
9	Lucia	...You mean Noctis and No. 21?	510003025	
10	Vera	Yeah. They wouldn't shut up about the renovations and insisted on coming out here. Along the way, they started arguing over whether mango or strawberry ice cream is better.	510003026	
11	Vera	The fight got out of hand, and they ended up knocking over all the display dishes in front of the restaurant.	510003027	
12	Vera	Kowloong Restaurant is demanding full compensation. On top of that, they're making the two of them wash dishes all day to make up for the emotional damage.	510003028	
13	Vera	They were still bickering while scrubbing plates, so I just left. Let them learn the hard way. I'll pick them up after closing.	510003029	
14	Lucia	I see... Kuroro Coffee closes around the same time as Kowloong Restaurant. It really is the perfect place to wait and relax.	510003030	
15	Vera	Since it's on my way, I might as well. But don't count on me for whatever noisy activities they've planned. I'm not interested in that.	510003031	
16	Vera	Let's go. I just need a quiet spot to pass the time.	510003032	
17	[PlayerName]	Sounds good.		
18	[PlayerName]	I'm all for it.		
19		We're here for an event at Kuroro Coffee.		
20	[PlayerName]	Something bothering you?		
21	[PlayerName]	"""A break from the noise""?"		
22	[PlayerName]	So... what happened to them?		
23	[PlayerName]	...Sounds like a mess.		
24		Would you like to come with us, Vera?
