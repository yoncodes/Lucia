1	Pete	Ross! Where the hell is he?! Tell him Master Pete is here to talk business!	520005040	
2	Pete	[PlayerName]?! Why are you here?!	520005041	
3	Pete	(Oh no, it's the Gray Raven Commandant... Stay calm, breathe...)	520005042	
4	Pete	You're wasting potential here. This product's great, but the marketing is a disaster!	520005043	
5	Pete	Hand the place over to me—that's the smart move.	520005044	
6	Pete	Alright, here's the offer: Ross, the staff, and you—each get 5% of the profits, no upper limit. Deal or no deal?	520005045	
7	Pete	Fine. But don't come crying when this place goes under next time I show up!	520005046	
8		I'm not letting Ross worry anymore. Time to focus on running the cafe.		
9		I'm managing the place for now. Can I help you?		
10		Feel free to report any issues to me, the acting store manager.		
11		What are you mumbling about?		
12		Get to the point.		
13		Ross is way more generous than that.		
14		I don't take contracts on someone else's behalf.
