1	Psychologist	Have you talked to Rhea yet? How did it go?		
2	Psychologist	That's excellent. Based on Rhea's current condition, I've prepared a treatment plan. In the early stages of therapy, we can try using items that might trigger her memories, gently guiding her along.		
3	Psychologist	Whenever Rhea mentions the Astral Canopy in Sequence Square, she smiles without knowing. Taking a close-up photo of its projection might help her remember something.		
4	Psychologist	According to Rhea's old habits, whenever she went to the surface, she would always bring a drink from Kuroro Coffee. The familiar taste might also awaken certain memories...		
5	Psychologist	"To help Rhea recover her memories, I wrote some special ""stories"" for her. They might come in handy now. I'll go print these stories out in a bit."		
6	Psychologist	[PlayerName], would you mind gathering the two items I just said? Let's meet back here shortly.		
7		It seems she's willing to open up to me.		
8		Is there anything I can do to help?		
9		Leave it to me.
