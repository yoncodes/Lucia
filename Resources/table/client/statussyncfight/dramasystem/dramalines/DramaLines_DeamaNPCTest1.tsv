1	Karenina	Gray Raven Commandant—hey, perfect timing. Take a seat.		
2	Karenina	This is a toy lie detector put together by an Engineering Force hobby group. It's actually pretty accurate.		
3	Karenina	For example, if I say...		
4	Karenina	Oh right, I gave those damn higher-ups a good scolding today.		
5	[PlayerName]	Karenina?		
6	[PlayerName]	What's that sound?		
7	Karenina	That means I'm telling the truth.		
8	Karenina	And... I haven't seen the Gray Raven Commandant today.		
9	[PlayerName]	Was that the wrong sound?		
10		(Sit down)		
11		(Stay standing)		
12		Backtrack Test		
13	Karenina	Yeah, just say anything.		
14	Karenina	Since you're already sitting, you're not allowed to leave! I'm not biting. Just say whatever comes to mind!		
15	Karenina	Heh, clever. They're planning to sell this later, and I just happen to need a guinea pig. You get what I mean.		
16		Want me to just say something random?		
17		But I refuse!		
18	[PlayerName]	(Can't resist!)		
19	Karenina	What's wrong? Why are you not saying anything?		
20		Can't think of anything to say right now.		
21		Let's play a riddle game—guess who I'm thinking of.		
22	Karenina	Huh? Leaving already...? Ahem, I-I mean, go ahead and do what you need to do!
