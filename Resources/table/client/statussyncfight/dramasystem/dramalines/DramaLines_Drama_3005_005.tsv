1	Competitive Kuroro	So lame! For a massive place like Babylonia, there's not even one decent opponent to be found. What a total letdown!		
2	Space Leap Staff	Whoa, keep it down, will you? Your last comment has made the opposing players mad...		
3	Competitive Kuroro	"Hmph! There's no shame in admitting defeat! What I can't stand are those who clearly lost but stand there mumbling excuses about ""momentary slip-ups,"" ""not being in top form,"" or ""simple carelessness""... I have zero respect for those people!"		
4	Space Leap Staff	Maybe... don't humiliate people like that?		
5	Space Leap Staff	Gray Raven Commandant? Sorry you had to see that.		
6	Space Leap Staff	"Early today, this Kuroro showed up out of nowhere and immediately broke our highest score. It's been hanging around ever since, claiming to be ""searching for worthy opponents."""		
7	Space Leap Staff	The problem is, whenever other players fail the challenge, it starts taunting them with all kinds of vicious trash talk... Several players have already been humiliated so badly that they just left.		
8	Space Leap Staff	Seriously, when are you going to leave? You're intimidating everyone just by standing there. Nobody wants to play anymore!		
9	Competitive Kuroro	I won't leave until I find a truly skilled challenger.		
10	Competitive Kuroro	Gray Raven Commandant? Interesting. Finally, someone noteworthy. So, do you have what it takes to break my record?		
11	Competitive Kuroro	Such confidence! Very well, if you can manage to break my record, I'll do whatever you ask.		
12	Space Leap Staff	Phew, with the Gray Raven Commandant here, I can finally relax. At least now this troublemaker might behave... I'm counting on you!		
13		What's happening?		
14		If I win, you have to come with me. What do you say?		
15		I'm ready. Let's begin.		
16		Give me a moment.
