1	[PlayerName]	The coordinates point right here...		
2	Vera	These are all recently expanded shops. Maybe the terminal's been blocked by one of them?	510002175	
3	Kushushu	Welcome to Cedar Shop! What can I get for you? Right now, we've got a great deal: buy anything, and get the same amount free!	510002176	
4	Kushushu	Oh! It's [PlayerName]! What can I get for you? Right now, we've got a great deal: buy anything, and get the same amount free!	510002177	
5	Vera	Tch. You sure talk a lot. Sounds like that speech module of yours needs to be sent back for repairs.	510002180	
6	Kushushu	Y-you're Vera...	510002181	
7	Vera	Out of the way. We need to inspect the shop. Won't take long.	510002182	
8	Kushushu	Y-yes! Please come in!	510002183	
9	Vera	You've got some nerve, locking public equipment inside your shop. What's next? People have to buy something just to use the terminal?	510002184	
10	Kushushu	M-maybe the expansion was done in a hurry... We honestly didn't notice the terminal was there.	510002185	
11	Vera	Tear this place down. Now.	510002186	
12	Kushushu	But... our lease says we have the right to renovate the entire site. We didn't notice the terminal, but the space should still belong to us.	510002187	
13	Kushushu	We've just stocked up on fresh goods. This cold storage room is really important for our business.	510002188	
14	[PlayerName]	Until we have a permanent solution, Cedar Shop can keep its current layout. But if anyone's looking for the terminal, you'll need to point them to it.		
15	[PlayerName]	If your lease checks out, I'll do my best to make sure you can keep the cold storage.		
16	Kushushu	Thank you so much, [PlayerName]!	510002189	
17	[PlayerName]	If possible, I'd like Cedar Shop to join the owners' committee. It'll help you collaborate and share resources with the other businesses.		
18	Kushushu	No problem at all! As long as we can keep the cold storage, Cedar Shop will follow whatever you say!	510002190	
19	[PlayerName]	This area... is bigger than I expected.		
20	Vera	Well, it's better than nothing. What do we do now—search shops one by one?	510002191	
21	[PlayerName]	Not long ago, I caught someone linked to the Flourish Guild. We could try questioning her.		
22	Vera	Sounds good. Let's go talk to her.	510002192	
23	Kushushu	A public terminal...? I've never seen one. Why not buy something instead? Right now, we've got a great deal: buy anything, and get the same amount free!	510002178	
24	Kushushu	Take a look at our products first. You'll definitely want to buy something, and we've got a great deal going on: buy anything, and get the same amount free!	510002179	
25		Hi. We need to inspect the inside of your store.		
26		Your storefront might be blocking a public terminal.		
27		I'm not here to shop.		
28		Let's check the terminal.		
29		Don't worry. I'll take care of this properly.
