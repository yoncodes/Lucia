1	Dominik's Invitation		"Dominik is the founder and CTO of the Science Council. To most, he is a hero of legend with his whereabouts remaining a mystery. Gray Raven Commandant once received his legacy. After opening it with the device Nanami made, the Commandant saw a video of Dominik. In the video, Dominik invited the Commandant to carry on his legacy, join him, and upload the Memory data to the Gestalt. After careful consideration, the Commandant refused. Later, the ""invitation"" was activated again by the Church of Machina, making it possible for those originally invited to enter the Inver-Hetero Tower."
2	Agent Zero		The first agent born by endowing the contaminating memetic with personality. In the current world, the contaminating memetic had been locked up in the Gestalt by Dominik for a long time before it was released in Main Story: Stars Ensnared and led to a series of disasters, including the crash of Babylonia's AI Terminal, the contamination of the Inver-Hetero Tower, and low Punishing Concentration in the Clean Zone.
3	Contaminating Memetic		The most primitive form of the Punishing Virus. It takes only a civilization capable of using zero-point energy for it to be born and contaminate the civilization's most cutting-edge technology. In the current world, it targeted the Gestalt but ended up being locked up by it. This has led to the incompletion of the Punishing Virus on Earth and has greatly reduced its spread and power.
4	Kairos		A humanoid Hetero-Creature created due to Lithos and Vonnegut's plan with Gray Raven Commandant's data. It possesses about 80% of the Commandant's memory data.
5	Science Council		In the current world, Dominik is the founder of the Science Council. These records and memories seem to belong to a different future.
6	Contaminating Memetic		The most primitive form of the Punishing Virus and Chaos Contamination. It takes only a civilization capable of using zero-point energy for it to be born and contaminate the civilization's most cutting-edge technology. In the world corrupted by Chaos Contamination, it invaded the time travel pod without being noticed. In the world corrupted by the Punishing Virus, it targeted the Gestalt but ended up being locked up by it. This has led to the incompletion of the Punishing Virus on Earth and has greatly reduced its spread and power.
7	Kairos		"A small humanoid Hetero-Creature created due to Lithos and Vonnegut's plan with Gray Raven Commandant's data. It possesses about 80% of the Commandant's memory data and was named ""Chaos"" by Agent Vonnegut."
8	Chaos Contamination		"The disaster after the contaminating memetic was released. In another future, the contaminating memetic was not stopped. Instead, it lurked in the ""time travel pod"""" and corrupted all its users. It only contaminated time travelers and those whose actions were affected by them and then used the ripple effect to spread. During the initial stage, it spreads slowly and its long asymptomatic incubation period provides enough time for itself to reach more people. Therefore, it was named """"Chaos"""", and thus the """"Chaos Contamination"". The infected would look as if they were suffering from some mental disease with typical symptoms such as auditory hallucinations, abnormal behaviors, and acts of violence. The actual symptoms are more complicated than what's described above."
9	Door		A mysterious time rift at the far end of the Hetero Tower's core floor. It seems to be a hidden shortcut to another civilization. However, no life on Earth has gone through the rift in one piece so far.
10	Year 2197		"In the current world, the contaminating memetic appeared in 2160. The contaminating memetic from 2197, however, belongs to another future. It brought ""the Chaos Contamination"""" instead of """"the Punishing Virus""."
11	Egg		"A special Hetero-Creature spawned from Vonnegut's plan. The ""Egg"" Lamia took away that holds Cinderelik's dead Memory. It has lost all its original features and only contains Cinderelik's memory."
12	Inver-Hetero Tower		"The mysterious tower in Main Story: Spiral of Chronos that initially only the Hyperreal frame was allowed to enter. Lee had gone through long exploration and sacrifice in the tower before finally changing the red core that brought the disaster, giving it the power to purify the Punishing Virus like an Inver-Device, hence the name 'Inver-Hetero Tower.' Whether it is a Hetero Tower or not, the time inside and outside it is different. No matter how long you have spent in it, when you are back to reality, the time of the real world is determined by the deviation at the exit. If the deviation is low, then for the outside world, you have only gone for a very short time. The ""Key"" can change your arrival time in the real world, to some extent."
13	Omega Weapon		A weapon developed based on the Omega File and capable of purifying the Punishing Virus. Made with great expense and wears out quickly when used alone. When equipped on a frame, it will become a huge burden for its M.I.N.D., so the user must have the adaptability of a specialized frame.
14	A Future That Belongs to Her		It seems she was born to another 'worldline?'
15	Rose		"Lithos' younger sister, and also seems to be a distant relative of Vanessa. Adopted and renamed ""Ann"" in Babylonia after separating from Lithos, she became a Project Winter undercover agent along with her husband. After the project was exposed, she died as a result of Kurono's conspiracy."
16	Side Effect		Time backtracking and complicated nightmare data will overload the mind. This is the 75th time backtracking. The two are back to the moment they just arrived in Constellia.
17	Hetero-Core Shard		"A ""gift"" from future Nanami with some ideas and methods for disassembling the Hetero Tower Core."
18	Condensation Liquid Pack		An emergent hemostasis medical instrument for Constructs.
19	Bot		A tool for the ▅▅▅▅ civilization to send and receive messages. All cities' bots are connected to a master computer placed on a special planet, through which countless data streams are sent, received, and spread among the galaxies.
20	Macro Model of the Cosmos		A macro model of the cosmos that displays the possibilities of cosmic evolution through a digital model. It's an attempt to visually reveal the nature of the universe and explore the laws of the universe's development.
21	[Vera]		Leader of Cerberus squad from Babylonia.
22	Sergeant Eleanor		Lilith.
23	Gabriel		One of the Ascendants searching for the Ascension-Network.
24	Kurono Orphanage		A welfare-oriented orphanage controlled by Kurono. It became a frontline battlefield for Construct research after the disaster.
25	The Norman Family		Norman Mining Corp's former leader, Charles Norman, had extensive cooperation with Dominik. Its current leader, Victoria Norman, is the sister of Teddy (real name: Christina Norman).
26	Data Wall I		"A data wall discovered by Teddy and the Gray Raven Commandant in Gestalt. As a ""blockade"" created by Dominik within Gestalt, the data wall may contain a vast amount of Golden Age technology materials and research results."
27	Data Wall II		"Gestalt was shortly infected when the Punishing Virus just broke out. Nithart timely connected the data disk Dominik gave her to Gestalt, a data disk with Dominik's consciousness data. ""Dominik"" and Gestalt together sealed away the contaminating memetic that invaded Gestalt, which led to the creation of the ""data wall."""
28	Heteromer Shard		Shards that fell from Chiko's body after her death, containing technologies that don't belong to this era.
29	The Egg		An egg that Lamia brought out from the Cradle of Deep Blue and gave to the Gray Raven Commandant.
30	Chaos Contamination		Contamination from Nemo and Vonnegut's timeline, similar to the Punishing Virus but more dangerous.
31	The Key		"""Invitation from the activated Dominik""—as the name is too long, the Gray Raven Commandant suggested calling it the ""Key"" after entering the Inver-Hetero Tower."
32	The Password		The outburst of the Punishing Virus opened a Hetero Tower rift on some floor in Constellia. Lucia and the Gray Raven Commandant got a temporary password in a previous battle and will soon be able to return to the Inver-Hetero Tower through the rift.
33	The Bridge		"The ""Bridge Across Dreams""—a secret tunnel extending from the Hetero Tower, carved out by the ""vanguard team"" members from Dominik's timeline."
34	Emotion Trimming		Kurono's early illegal Construct technology. It removes excess consciousness, fades and erases overly painful memories, and seals away emotions one doesn't want to remember.
35	Wanshi's Treatment Case		The Science Council has newly established a project group specialized in studying various types of Construct M.I.N.D. disruptions. Wanshi has provided a new treatment approach as a clinical case.
36	Thebesia		A nation of prosperity and great military power.
37	Kerentos		"A small coastal country near Thebesia, the homeland of ""Gray Raven."""
38	"""Mineral-E"""		A mineral discovered under the leadership of ▇▇▇▇ Corporation. Its crystal structure is remarkably unusual, and researchers suspect it may hold far greater potential than expected.
39	Cradle		Humanoid Hetero-Creatures born from the Red Tide, capable of independent thought.
40	Post-Pandemic Age		When the Punishing Virus erupted from the Zero-Point Reactor, it ended the Golden Age and marked the beginning of the Post-Pandemic Age.
