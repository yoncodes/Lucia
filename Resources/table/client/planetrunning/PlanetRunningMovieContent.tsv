33	10303	Pale Phantom	...Is that so?			4
34	10303	Pale Phantom	What you're looking for is not here. This planet has gone on the wrong path. It's my duty to correct it.	No01		4
35	10303	Pale Phantom	As a reward for defeating me, I will escort you out of here this one time.			4
36	10303	No. 21	What about you?	Click01		1

53	20103	White Strike Hawk	Ah... Because it's not necessary to fight anymore.			5
54	20103	White Strike Hawk	Since you're not afraid of the danger ahead, I have no reason to stop you.			5
55	20103	White Strike Hawk	But the planet has nothing but ice. What you want is not here. If you want to keep going, find the unicorn on the snowfield.	Talk01		5
56	20103	White Strike Hawk	She will tell you what to do.			5
57	20103	White Strike Hawk	I'm drained... I need to rest.	Tired01		5

61	20202	Red Gray Raven	Who's there?!	Click01		6
62	20203	Red Gray Raven	...I think you misunderstood.			6
63	20203	Red Gray Raven	My treasure... is my friends. I was guarding a bright star with two other ravens like me.	Talk01		6
64	20203	Red Gray Raven	But we got separated due to an accident. I've been looking for them.			6
65	20203	Red Gray Raven	Please take this.	Scratch01		6

72	20302	Purple Unicorn	Show me what you can do first.			7
73	20302	No. 21	Huh?	Click01	101	1
74	20302	Purple Unicorn	I'm the guard of the planet. If you can't defeat me, you don't have the ability to leave the planet.	Talk01		7
75	20302	No. 21	I'll prove my strength to you!	Talk01		1
76	20303	Purple Unicorn	...You're qualified.			7
77	20303	Purple Unicorn	In this case, I'll stick to my promise and help get out of here.	Talk01		7
78	20303	No. 21	The treasure I look for is not here...	Stand03		1
79	20303	Purple Unicorn	Leave for the closest planet around here. There is an all-capable merchant there. Perhaps he can help you find what you want.	Talk01		7
80	20303	No. 21	Why are you staying here since there's nothing to guard?	Click01		1
81	20303	Purple Unicorn	Because my friends are here. We had a promise, which for me... is the most precious treasure.	Talk01		7
82	30101		—The unicorn threw out a javelin as big as the smallest spaceship. The wolf cub clung to it, traveling through the dangerous asteroid belt and arriving on the third planet.	Click01		1
83	30101	No. 21	So much sand...			1
84	30101	No. 21	I could be swallowed. Need to be careful.			1

90	30102	No. 21	What are these?		101	1
91	30102	Desert Merchant	"This fits in your requirement of ""getting stronger."" Our items are very popular on this planet."	Talk01		8
92	30102	Desert Merchant	You can try it out if you're worried about the quality.			8
93	30102	Desert Merchant	...Please get ready.			8
94	30103	Desert Merchant	...Oh, I screwed up.	Stand03	105	8

97	30103	No. 21	...No.	No01		1
98	30103	No. 21	I only believe in the power of my claws.			1
99	30103	No. 21	"This ""power"" seems weird. It's not what I want."			1
100	30103	No. 21	Bye.			1
101	30103	Desert Merchant	...			8
102	30103	Desert Merchant	"What is the true ""power""...?"			8
103	30202	Oasis Leader	It's Oasis territory. Unidentified people are not allowed to go there. Show me your token.	Talk01		9
104	30202	No. 21	Token? I don't have any token.	No01	101	1
105	30202	Oasis Leader	You have to defeat me if you insist on going in.			9
106	30202	Oasis Leader	Someone, lock this stranger up in the jail.			9

109	30203	Oasis Leader	...You're more daring than I imagined.			9
110	30203	No. 21	I've defeated many enemies. All fierce machines. So I'm strong... and I can still fight.	Talk01		1
111	30203		Something falls from No. 21.			
112	30203	Oasis Leader	Why do you have this?			9
113	30203	No. 21	I promised a red gray raven to give it to her friends. Give it back to me!		102	1
114	30203	Oasis Leader	So you're not working for the Guardian of the Ruins... This is a mistake. The gray raven is my ally. Please accept my apology.	Talk01		9
115	30203	No. 21	Mmm... The Guardian of the Ruins?		101	1
116	30203	Oasis Leader	...The Guardian of the Ruins is the ruler of the planet, a militant who turned this green planet into what it is.			9
117	30203	Oasis Leader	My job is to bring the oasis back to this planet... For me, Oasis residents' happiness is the most precious treasure.			9
118	30203	Oasis Leader	But the war will never end as long as the Guardian of the Ruins is still here.			9
119	30203	No. 21	Green is the color of the forest. I like it. I saw some greenness on my way... but not much. The planet is full of sand. I don't like it.	Show01		1
120	30203	No. 21	Where I came from is full of greenness. It's tough, so there can be greenness as well.			1
121	30203	No. 21	I can help you kill the bad guy who ruined the greenness. Lead the way.			1
122	30203	Oasis Leader	Thank you for your help.	Thanks03	103	9

134	30303	No. 21	I'm looking for a treasure. Do you know where it is?	Talk01		1
135	30303	Guardian of the Ruins	A treasure? There is a treasure...			10
136	30303	Guardian of the Ruins	There is a planet far away from here... The last ruler of that planet might have what you want.			10
137	30303	Guardian of the Ruins	However, it's far away from here. And there's a dangerous place on the way.			10
138	30303	No. 21	I have nothing to fear with my claws and friends.			1
139	30303	Guardian of the Ruins	Ugh—! This is the map to that planet! Please keep your claws away from you.			10

144	40102		The Blast Rabbit stamps its foot in anger and doesn't notice the wolf cub around it.	Refuse01		11
145	40102	Blast Rabbit	Why are the collectors I left on the way all damaged?		102	11
146	40102	Blast Rabbit	Ahh! I have to start over again. If I find out who did it...		102	11
147	40102	No. 21	Mmm, what's the smell...?	Click01		1

151	40103	No. 21	I'll get stronger in the story.	Gift01	103	1
152	40103	Blast Rabbit	What does that mean...? Never mind. Let's fight. I'm not sure if you were the one who destroyed the device.		101	11
153	40103	No. 21	You can smell that too?			1
154	40103	Blast Rabbit	No! You won't leave traces like these. Just have a look.			11
155	40103	Blast Rabbit	Cough, sorry.			11
156	40103	No. 21	No need to apologize. I didn't do it, but I can help you fix it. I'm quite good at it.			1
157	40103	Blast Rabbit	No need to do that. The fact that it's damaged means that the material is not strong enough! I'd rather start over.	Show07		11
158	40103	Blast Rabbit	Hmm, this time I'm gonna adjust the proportions of metals... This is better. Just two more blasting experiments...			11
159	40103		The Blast Rabbit is lost in work.	Cabinet01		11

165	40203		One blue gray raven is down, but another blue gray raven comes up.			12
166	40203	Blue Gray Raven	I can't believe that you've seen through my trap. It seems that the test model is not qualified... What brought you here?	Talk01		12
167	40203	No. 21	The red gray raven asked me to give it to you. She was looking for her kind. I could smell it.	Show01		1
168	40203	Blue Gray Raven	Now I see... I am one of the Gray Raven members.			12
169	40203	No. 21	Then why don't you go back?		101	1
170	40203	Blue Gray Raven	...I've got other business to attend to. Our star won't be truly saved until I finish it, so I have to stay.			12
171	40203	Blue Gray Raven	Thank you for the update on my teammates. In return, I would like to offer you anything you need.			12

185	40303	No. 21	...Hmm! I can't move... Why...?		101	1
186	40303	Bad Guy	Buddy, you are brave and strong, but you're not gonna help you survive on the planet.	Talk01		13
187	40303	Bad Guy	Each story features a charming villain, so... I'll have the spaceship.			13
188	40303	Bad Guy	However, as a kind captain, I can consider giving you a lift.			13

218	50203	No. 21	"...What ""price""?"		101	1
219	50203	The Best Warrior in the Universe	Give up something that's very important to you in return for something that's more important.			15
