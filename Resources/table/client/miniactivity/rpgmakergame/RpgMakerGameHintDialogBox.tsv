1101	Keep going forward—looks like this is our only option.	3	3	3
1102	It seems like you'll have to get through the crucial Kuroro from the right to reach the endpoint...	3	3	3
1103	A Kuroro will run in the opposite direction if either a Construct shows up around it or another character is eliminated.	3	3	3
1104	It doesn't seem like you'll be able to make it to the endpoint going down. Is there a way to move the crucial Kuroro downward, though...	3	3	3
1105	Can you somehow push the crucial Kuroro to the left so it moves in sync with the patrolman...?	3	3	3
1106	Why don't you try approaching it from the side with Tai'E's help since you can't get close to it from below?	3	3	3
1107	And Tai'E only shows up on odd rounds, eh... I see what you're saying. We definitely can't miss this opportunity.	3	3	3
1108	You can make it straight to the endpoint if You can push the Kuroro on the right to the top.	3	3	3
1109	If you want to push Kuroro upward to make it a stepping stone, you'll need to take advantage of the fact that it runs away when it gets scared.	3	3	3
1110	It seems like you can keep moving and change location and direction if you move close to Tai'E from the side.	3	3	3
1201	I have a bad feeling about these pools. You just might be able to make your way through them if you can freeze them.	3	3	3
1202	Kuroros will run away in fear, too, if the character around its fall into the water.	3	3	3
1203	There is water all around the Kuroro at the bottom. Maybe we don't need to make our hands dirty at all, Commandant.	3	3	3
1204	You can probably use the Kuroro in the upper-right corner. Keep it safe until you're done using it.	3	3	3
1205	It seems like there is no way you'll ever be able to reach the Kuroro up there... Guess you'll need a few extra hands.	3	3	3
1206	After spotting an abnormal occurrence in its sight, the Roseblade will move to where it took place in the next round.	3	3	3
1207	Roseblade won't stop in front of the pool. If only you can move it forward...	3	3	3
1208	Is there a way we can move the Kuroro in the middle down to the bottom...?	3	3	3
1209	You need to catch the stepping stone with another stone so it won't fall into the water.	3	3	3
1210	The butler won't come down for you if you don't knock on the door.	3	3	3
1301	Be careful. The Kuroro carries fire with it, and fire will melt ice...	3	3	3
1302	The Kuroro has decided to burn through the ice. You'll have to go around to get close to it, then.	3	3	3
1303	If you stand on the green mark, all the stone gates with the same mark will drop down.	3	3	3
1304	You need someone to keep these stone gates from going back up so you can get close to the Kuroro in the bottom-left corner...	3	3	3
1305	Let's burn the grass first. The path that appeared doesn't seem like a difficult walk at all.	3	3	3
1306	The Kuroro at the bottom is wrapped up in ice under the bushes. Try to get close to it from the side.	3	3	3
1307	There are quite a few pools on the field, and the Kuroro is an Ice Kuroro. I wonder if we can somehow get its help...	3	3	3
1308	You'll need to come up with a way to burn down the grass that's blocking its way before luring out Roseblade.	3	3	3
1309	Now, imagine for a second that the Kuroro up there is all alone by itself...	3	3	3
1310	Move up the Fire Kuroro at the bottom so it can work with the Kuroro on the right.	3	3	3
1401	The Lightning Circle pulls in all the characters and Kuroros that carry Lightning Attribute with them.	3	3	3
1402	Use Lightning Circle	3	3	3
1403	Pushing Kuroros into the water seems to come with more benefits than one.	3	3	3
1404	If you can somehow keep the Kuroro from moving away from the Lightning Circle on the right...	3	3	3
1405	Now, both Kuroros carry Lightning Attribute with them—which doesn't just happen for no reason. It has to be a hint.	3	3	3
1406	Move to the right from the get-go and let miracles happen.	3	3	3
1407	Lightning Attribute still works even when it's carried by a Kuroro.	3	3	3
1408	Push the Kuroro to the right and make the grass grow so you can land on it.	3	3	3
1409	You need to clear the path up to the endpoint with Roseblade. Try to block its way with the grass.	3	3	3
1410	Head to the right and block Tai'E clockwise. The endpoint is right there.	3	3	3
1501	You don't have another choice... Need I say more, Commandant?	3	3	3
1502	It teleports everything—even Kuroros, yes. Chase it down and make it your stepping stone.	3	3	3
1503	Let's familiarize ourselves with it: Teleport it into the mist and follow it.	3	3	3
1504	The mist has multiple entrances and exits, so best of luck choosing the right path.	3	3	3
1505	To start with, you can try getting rid of the elemental Kuroros, Commandant.	3	3	3
1506	Hold off on changing direction when you're done eliminating the Kuroro at the bottom. See, there is a crypt below the Lightning Circle.	3	3	3
1507	Try destroying the Lightning Circle on the left, Commandant. The Kuroro will take care of the rest.	3	3	3
1508	Try to make the Kuroro on the left fall into the water, then approach the crucial Kuroro using Teleporting Mist.	3	3	3
1509	It seems like you'll have to make a round.	3	3	3
1510	It doesn't seem like you can make it straight to the endpoint... You'll have to catch the Kuroros that fall and make them into a wall to catch yourself with.	3	3	3
2101	Keep going forward—looks like this is our only option.	3	3	3
2102	Changing your direction immediately after you stop doesn't seem to work here.	3	3	3
2103	I see... A Kukuro will run in the opposite direction whenever a Construct shows up near it.	3	3	3
2104	And it seems like they get scared and run away, too, when enemies around them are eliminated.	3	3	3
2105	If you could push the upper-right Kuroro up...	3	3	3
2106	It will be easier if we can patch the opening on the left.	3	3	3
2107	Watch out, Commandant. That red circle shows Shark-speare's detection range.	3	3	3
2108	The walls in front of the endpoint are pretty smooth. How do I make it to the other side...?	3	3	3
2109	Look carefully. There are only two paths leading to the endpoint. If you can take one of them...	3	3	3
2110	Tai'E moves along a fixed route in each turn... And anything with a predictable pattern can be exploited.	3	3	3
2201	You will also be able to control the shadows, but they won't scare Kuroro off or eliminate them.	3	3	3
2202	Hmm... Is there a way to get pass the walls and get to the area below?	3	3	3
2203	It seems there is only one entrance to the area below.	3	3	3
2204	Those holes look dangerous... Remember to avoid them.	3	3	3
2205	Kuroro will be scared and run if someone falls into a trap hole.	3	3	3
2206	You have to sacrifice your own shadow when necessary.	3	3	3
2207	It seems better to reach the Kuroro on the left edge from above or right.	3	3	3
2208	The key is to get back to the area above from below and reach the endpoint.	3	3	3
2209	On the bright side, with the detection range and traps around, we're bound to steer clear of some of the wrong paths.	3	3	3
2210	The endpoint and Shark-speare are surrounded by walls. Is there anything we can use as a stepping stone...?	3	3	3
2301	The Electro-Walls are electrified, so be careful not to bump into them. Step on the switch to turn them off.	3	3	3
2302	You don't always need to get your hands dirty to get what you want.	3	3	3
2303	One and only objective: Turn off the switch.	3	3	3
2304	You don't have to push every single button, Commandant. Stay focused.	3	3	3
2305	There is only one entrance at the endpoint. How can we get there...?	3	3	3
2306	Turn off the switch before using the Kuroro as stepping stones, otherwise, they will be eliminated by the Electro-Walls.	3	3	3
2307	We have to find a stepping stone to reach the endpoint after eliminating the Kuroro in the upper-left corner...	3	3	3
2308	Don't be scared by the Electro-Walls, Commandant. Those are just paper tigers.	3	3	3
2309	Try to finish the battle in the middle of the battlefield. Don't let Kuroro escape to the right side.	3	3	3
2310	Sometimes you need to move more than once to get Kuroro to the place where it needs to be.	3	3	3
2401	I know it's hard but please keep me safe, Commandant.	3	3	3
2402	Watch out for the trap hole on the right. Even I don't want to fall into it.	3	3	3
2403	Try to kill Shark-speare first.	3	3	3
2404	Get the Kuroro above down and use it as a stepping stone, not me.	3	3	3
2405	Sometimes you have to take the longer path to make the best use of your stepping stone, Commandant.	3	3	3
2406	You want to evacuate people who shouldn't be there before starting a hunt.	3	3	3
2407	Don't fight Kuroro the second you enter the battle. Take a walk around it first.	3	3	3
2408	You only have a few ways to reach the key Kuroro. Moving from left to right could be a good idea.	3	3	3
2409	You could use the help of Celica when necessary, Commandant.	3	3	3
2410	...I can also be your assistant if necessary, Commandant.	3	3	3
2501	After spotting an abnormal occurrence in its sight, the Roseblade will move to where it took place in the next round.	3	3	3
2502	Distract the Roseblade and don't look back no matter what is blocking your way.	3	3	3
2503	You could use the help of your allies, including me, when necessary, Commandant.	3	3	3
2504	Enemies that will only move under certain conditions are just moving stepping stones.	3	3	3
2505	You have to stop the Kuroro on the left to reach the Kuroro on the right.	3	3	3
2506	Use the Roseblade as your stepping stone, Commandant.	3	3	3
2507	You can never have too many stepping stones. Get yourself two stepping stones if one is not enough.	3	3	3
2508	Places that are hard to reach won't be a big deal when you have the help of the stepping stones.	3	3	3
2509	I've seen a complete letter S. You are on its tail, Commandant.	3	3	3
2510	The Roseblade here won't stay very long. You need to make him stay somewhere.	3	3	3
3101	Keep going forward—looks like this is our only option.	3	3	3
3102	Think about it... If Kuroro on the left wasn't there...	3	3	3
3103	Changing your direction immediately after you stop doesn't seem to work here.	3	3	3
3104	I see... A Kukuro will run in the opposite direction whenever a Construct shows up near it.	3	3	3
3105	It's a bit far... But there must be a way to approach the Kuroro up top.	3	3	3
3106	The Kuroro on the right cannot be eliminated directly, but if you use that...	3	3	3
3107	Make good use of your enemies, Commandant.	3	3	3
3108	Instead of eliminating each enemy, maybe you can use them to your advantage.	3	3	3
3201	Watch out, Commandant. That red circle shows Shark-speare's detection range.	3	3	3
3202	The area outside the red circle is Shark-speare's blind spot. Time to strike now!	3	3	3
3203	The enemies on the top side are impossible to break through... Why not turn to the ones on the bottom?	3	3	3
3204	"""Move along a fixed route in each turn""... Indeed, the more regular of a routine, the easier it is to spot a fatal flaw."	3	3	3
3205	Sometimes it's not bad to take a detour...	3	3	3
3206	Only if you can lure the Kuroro to the bottom left corner... But how?	3	3	3
3207	That patrolman was just bluffing. Don't let him get away, Commandant!	3	3	3
3208	There are two Kuroro... You have to think carefully about which one should be dealt with first.	3	3	3
3301	There's only one way for sure, right, Commandant?	3	3	3
3302	Let's ignore the Kuroro on your left for now.	3	3	3
3303	Looks like they're going in different directions. If we choose the right one...	3	3	3
3304	If you're finding it difficult... Why not take a look at the Kuroro on the right?	3	3	3
3305	It's not difficult to predict their next move based on their movement pattern. Go right first, Commandant.	3	3	3
3306	The patrolman and stone gate are in line with each other. If we can trap him...	3	3	3
3307	Looks like... Now's the time to take down all the enemies at once.	3	3	3
3308	The Kuroro up top can't be taken out from here, but if you can use that...	3	3	3
3401	...I'm sure you're aware that you've only got one choice.	3	3	3
3402	Please keep in mind that a new path might form when the terrain changes, Commandant.	3	3	3
3403	...It's a dead end? Well then, we'll just have to make them clear the way!	3	3	3
3404	The top one seems to be a decoy... Wanna know how I know that? My intuition!	3	3	3
3405	Let's eliminate the enemies on the bottom first, Commandant.	3	3	3
3406	It's fine to let your enemies run for a while... And please remember to count your steps.	3	3	3
3407	The terrain toward the top is complicated. Don't let your enemies get there, Commandant.	3	3	3
3408	It's not always bad to take a detour... Hmm? Is that an infinity symbol?	3	3	3
4101	There's only one way ahead. Let's go!	3	3	3
4102	The key is to keep moving after the shadow kills the key Kuroro.	3	3	3
4103	A Kuroro will run in the opposite direction if either a Construct shows up around it or another character is eliminated.	3	3	3
4104	Use two ordinary Kuroros to help you to reach the destination first and save the bunny for last.	3	3	3
4105	When you or your shadow reaches the magic circle, the one who has reached it will stop and wait for the other one to act. Then, the two of you will swap positions.	3	3	3
4106	It seems there's only one exit in the lower right area... We have to step on something to get out, don't we?	3	3	3
4107	It seems we have to drive the Kuroro down there to the left side of the map to get to the destination...	3	3	3
4108	Once you or your shadow enters Shark-speare's range of attack, the one who enters it will be killed by Shark-speare.	3	3	3
4109	Don't touch the Electro-Walls when they are powered on. Step on the switch to turn them off.	3	3	3
4110	Drive the Kuroro on the left to the electric net to shock another Kuroro and cover up Shark-speare's range of attack.	3	3	3
4201	You can burn the grass. There is only one way. Let's go.	3	3	3
4202	Perhaps the grass is just an ornament. Kill the key Kuroro directly and move to the destination. Your shadow will clear the way for you.	3	3	3
4203	Your shadow can make the grass grow, while you can burn grass that is connected together. Set Kuroro free to get to the destination!	3	3	3
4204	Burn the grass to save the shadow. Let it kill the Kuroro up there and then move to the destination with it!	3	3	3
4205	Crack the mechanism to let yourself move to the destination. Use the spikes to keep yourself ahead of your shadow!	3	3	3
4206	Turn off the electro-wall switch to keep your shadow safe and then move to the center together!	3	3	3
4207	Turn on the switch to make your shadow move to the right side to kill Kuroro together! And then try to touch the stone gate on the right side to get back!	3	3	3
4208	Get through the magic circle so that you and your shadow can act separately!	3	3	3
4209	What's under the grass on the left? Is it a mechanism? Touch it and walk along the edges of the map!	3	3	3
4210	Watch where you are and then use the grass grown by your shadow to stop yourself from sprinting. You might be safe when your shadow reaches the stone gate switch!	3	3	3
4301	Physical elements can push the bubble one step ahead, while ice elements will break it.	3	3	3
4302	Try again! Push the bubble and let your shadow use t to open a path for you.	3	3	3
4303	Move the bubble to a proper position to make your shadow break it.	3	3	3
4304	Those holes look dangerous... Remember to avoid them.	3	3	3
4305	Let your shadow move to the left and swap your positions when time's right. Believe me, this is a necessary sacrifice.	3	3	3
4306	Move to the right immediately at the beginning and swap positions. To let your shadow break the bubble, we have to make more use of the Swapping Circles.	3	3	3
4307	Think of a way to get the bubble in the key Kuroro's way to avoid it from going into the trap!	3	3	3
4308	It looks like we have to move the bubble first and then use the key Kuroro to reach the destination.	3	3	3
4309	Drive the key Kuroro down, and then... If there's a way to make the two Kuroros down there our stepping stones...	3	3	3
4310	Drive the Kuroro up there down and then take the advantage of Kuroro's scare mechanism to make both Kuroros reach the correct positions.	3	3	3
4401	Let your shadow rush to the destination!	3	3	3
4402	Hold your horses and let your shadow go first.	3	3	3
4403	Move along the pool and try to meet with your shadow.	3	3	3
4404	Move right across the warning line so you can kill Kuroro.	3	3	3
4405	Meet with your shadow first and then let it hunt Kuroro down.	3	3	3
4406	Order your shadow to show the Roseblades on both sides what it can do! Patrol one more round and you'll find the way out.	3	3	3
4407	Take care of Tai'E and then switch positions.	3	3	3
4408	Swap positions twice and you'll reach the destination directly.	3	3	3
4409	Take a detour to switch positions. Then, go through the pool and switch again.	3	3	3
4410	Order the shadow in the top right corner to move around and try to switch positions with it.	3	3	3
4501	Use the steel plate to scare Kuroro away and move to the destination!	3	3	3
4502	The destination is right ahead... Touch the wall and turn around!	3	3	3
4503	Scare away Kuroro and kill it! Then use the steel plate to reach the destination! Does that mean that those mechanisms are simply distractions...?	3	3	3
4504	Use your shadow to kill all the Kuroros. Then, use the Swapping Circles to swap positions to reach the destination.	3	3	3
4505	Perhaps you can use the spikes to move to the upper area of the map. Use the steel plate to reach the stone gate switch!	3	3	3
4506	The steel plates make it hard for you to move around. Can we try with the shadow? But it seems that the shadow can't stay on the steel plate for too long...	3	3	3
4507	Keep trying! Keep circling! Get yourself closer to the bottom gradually...	3	3	3
4508	The spikes can make you stop at the exit of the stone gate. Use the shadow on the right side to open a path!	3	3	3
4509	Dead end! Move yourself to the steel plate and then start over!	3	3	3
4510	Order your shadow to kill Kuroro and use the steel plate to keep yourself somewhere you can get back to the stone gate switch.	3	3	3
