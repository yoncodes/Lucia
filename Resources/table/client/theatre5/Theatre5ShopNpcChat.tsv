1001	1		You are back... I can see the threads around you weigh heavier now. Keep moving forward with them and everything you reaped.	100
1002	1		It seems you're more interested in me than the power of the runes? Look in my eyes and seize my hand. I will take you to the world of us two for a pilgrimage... that will get rid of fatigue for good.	100
2001	2		What kind of power you get is determined by what kind of price you're willing to pay.	100

2003	2		Sacrifices are an inevitable part of the cause you undertake. Don't be stingy with your possessions. Each and every investment of yours will be richly rewarded.	100
3001	3		We burn the past to welcome the future. Just like what the world did to us.	100
3002	3		Yesterday's parting is for a better reunion tomorrow. Get rid of those corrupted. Let them become a part of your journey, get rejuvenated on your way, and blossom into a sea of flowers.	100
