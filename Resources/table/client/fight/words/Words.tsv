1502040501	"Vera: This is way too ""clean."" It's almost like... someone is still living here."	[2.5, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5]		3
1502040501		[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]		4
1502040501	Vanessa: Could it be those experimental Constructs on the trees outside?	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		5
1502040501		[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]		6
1502040501	Vera: Playing house here? Unlikely.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		7
1502040502	Bambinata: Wait... Someone is watching...	[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]		1
1502040502		[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]		2
1502040502	Bambinata: There.	[1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5]		3
1502040503	Bambinata: No experiment items found.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040503		[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]		2
1502040503	Bambinata: But the layout of the walls here doesn't fully make sense... Not sure if they have been altered before.	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		3
1502040503		[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]		4
1502040503	Vanessa: So they've hidden the tracks of their experiments.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		5
1502040504	Vera: ...The door's here. Did you expect me to tell you this?	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040505	Vera: Surveillance? So we've been monitored by someone behind the camera ever since we walked into this place?	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		1
1502040506	Vanessa: If there's surveillance equipment, there's a security room storing the footage. The data storage devices must still be running.	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		1
1502040506		[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]		2
1502040506	Vanessa: Let's see if there are any clues to the location of the security room.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		3
1502040507	Vera: Hey, look.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040508	Vera: These dolls have something in their bellies.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040509	Vera: The schedule here seems quite healthy.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040510	Vera: Over here. Has this bear... been here all the time?	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040511		[0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 0.75]	100000928	1
1502040511	???: ...Come on.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		2
1502040512	Vera: Hey, stop zoning out, dollface!	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040513	Bambinata: The security room is in there.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040514	Vera: Behind the shelf? How did you know that?	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040515	Bambinata: There is a strange memory... in Bambinata's M.I.N.D.	[2.5, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5]		1
1502040515		[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]		2
1502040515	Vanessa: When did it show up?	[1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5]		3
1502040515		[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]		4
1502040515	"Bambinata: Just now... Bambinata has scanned her frame, and no anomaly is found. But... Bambinata can ""remember"" someone passing through here."	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		5
1502040515		[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]		6
1502040515	Vanessa: Let's see if there's anything unusual about this bookshelf first.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		7
1502040516	Bambinata: Do we blow this place up, Mistress?	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040516		[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]		2
1502040516	Vanessa: Let's avoid impacting the electronics and data with the explosions. We'll start with scanning it.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		3
1502040517	Vera: The shelf has electrical reactions as expected, but the activation requires admin authentication.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040518	Vera: Can we find it in the memory?	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040519	Bambinata: Hmm... The data is not complete. Let Bambinata try to fix it.	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		1
1502040520	Vanessa: Wait, let's be more careful. Establish a deep M.I.N.D. connection with me first, Bambinata.	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		1
1502040521	Vanessa: And Cerberus, you keep an eye on things and help out Bambinata.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040523	Bambinata: Broken memory data... Should be able to make it more consistent if Bambinata can adjust the time perception.	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		1
1502040523		[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]		2
1502040523	Bambinata: The core data that appears to be the administrator is standing by the bed. Is it time to rest?	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		3
1502040524	Mother: Time, to rest. Sleep on time.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040524		[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]		2
1502040524	Mother: Good girl, ▇▇▇, rewarded. Have a, good dream, tonight.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		3
1502040525	Bambinata: ...	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040526	Bambinata: The same wooden horse... This memory must have taken place before the game time, I guess?	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		1
1502040527	Bambinata: Something is missing... Mistress should be able to find it.	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		1
1502040528	Bambinata: The time of the memory is not accurate enough.	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		1
1502040529	Bambinata: Something is missing... Mistress should be able to find it.	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		1
1502040530	Mother: Good children, tidy up toys. Otherwise, you'll become, naughty children.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040530		[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]		2
1502040530	Mother: Naughty children, will be, punished.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		3
1502040531	Bambinata: These memories... Is this where Bambinata used to live?	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040532	Mother: Game time, now. Good children, make use of, calculation module.	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		1
1502040533	Bambinata: Mistress never told Bambinata about her past.	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		1
1502040534	Vera: Hmm? Did I touch something by mistake? Sorry—	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		1
1502040534		[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]		2
1502040534	Vera: But you should stay lying down!	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		3
1502040535	Bambinata: Resume data recovery.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040536	Vera: Looks like someone's keeping a secret from you, dollface.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040537	Vera: All eliminated.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040538	Vera: That's it?	[1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5]		1
1502040538		[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]		2
1502040538	Bambinata: Data recovery complete.	[1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5]		3
1502040540	Vanessa: Bambinata, investigate inside the building.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040540		[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]		2
1502040540	Bambinata: Yes, Mistress.	[1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5]		3
1502040539	Vanessa: They look... more like they're running out from inside.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040539		[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]		2
1502040539	Vera: There seems to be something here that scares them.	[1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5]		3
1502040541	Vera:Hm? It seems that I still have to adjust the clock.	[2.5, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5]		1
1502040601	Vera: The terminal only has the data track of the surveillance record. Someone has modified it.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040602	Vanessa: There has to be something related to the experiment. Look deeper.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040603	Bambinata: Bambinata can try to fix these data fragments like she did earlier.	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		1
1502040604	Vera: With your external memory module?	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		1
1502040605	Vanessa: Bambinata, stop if any error occurs.	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		1
1502040606	Bambinata: Yes, Mistress.	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		1
1502040607		[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040608	Vera: What? The data download panel is over there.	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		1
1502040609	Bambinata: I must not leave without Mistress' permission.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040610	Bambinata: Successfully entered the recovery space.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040611	Vanessa: Look for anything related to the experiment or architectural blueprints.	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		1
1502040612	Bambinata: Understood.	[1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5]		1
1502040613	Bambinata: Space recovery interrupted... Could there be a data deviation?	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		1
1502040614	Bambinata: The recovered security room might have the information you need, Mistress... It's straight ahead.	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		1
1502040615	Bambinata: What just flashed before me...?	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040616		[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		1
1502040617	Bambinata: It shouldn't be here. Looks like the items have to be matched with the correct data.	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		1
1502040618	Bambinata: The data deviation is down.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040619	Bambinata: Data deviation corrected, Mistress. Bambinata is off to the next area.	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		1
1502040620	Bambinata: ...Mistress?	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040621		[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040622	Bambinata: There it is, an architectural blueprint. Bambinata will immediately sync it to your terminal, Mistress.	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		1
1502040623	Bambinata: Forming data connection...	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040624	Bambinata: Transmitting data...	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040625	Bambinata: Data transmission completed...	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040626	Vera: File transmission? It's the architectural blueprint. Your doll made it.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040626		[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]		2
1502040626	Vanessa: Good. Bambinata, you can stop for now.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		3
1502040627	"Bambinata?: ...Come here... Come to ""Mother""—"	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		1
1502040628	Vera: What did you say?	[1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5]		1
1502040628		[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]		2
1502040628	Bambinata?: There's a voice o-outside... outside. You should go c-check it out.	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		3
1502040628		[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]		4
1502040628	Vera: ...	[1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5]		5
1502040629	Bambinata: Mistress? ...Communication channel interrupted. Have to find a way to get back to Mistress immediately.	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		1
1502040630		[0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 0.75]	100000928	1
1502040630	???: ...Come on.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		2
1502040631	Bambinata: What are these...? Should they be in the data fragments by default?	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040632		[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040633	Bambinata: This is... an abnormal data fragment?	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040634	Bambinata: It turns out that these data fragments are their memories...	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040635	Bambinata: Who are you? Did you interrupt the communication between Bambinata and Mistress?	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040636	Bambinata: The words on the barque... Should be left by the friend of the constructor of this building.	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		1
1502040636		[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]		2
1502040636	Bambinata: Being on the sea, sail. Being on the land, settle...	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		3
1502040637	Bambinata: The corridor has changed?!	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040638	Bambinata: Being on the sea, sail. Being on the land, settle... Could the ship's bow indicate the direction to open the door?	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		1
1502040639	Bambinata: Wait... Did I see this corridor before?	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040639		[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]		2
1502040639	Bambinata: Was there a data deviation during the space recovery?	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		3
1502040640	Bambinata: Am I back again? Or?	[1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5]		1
1502040640		[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]		2
1502040640	Bambinata: Mistress? Mistress?	[1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5]		3
1502040640		[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]		4
1502040640	Bambinata: ...Comms is unresponsive.	[1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5]		5
1502040640		[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]		6
1502040640	Bambinata: Bambinata needs to find the right way to the security room.	[1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5]		7
1502040641	Bambinata: Who's there?	[1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5]		1
1502040642	Bambinata: ...	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040643	Bambinata: The security room. Found it.	[1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5]		1
1502040644	Bambinata: Who's there!	[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]		1
1502040645	Bambinata: The security room... is not this way.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040646	Vera: Dollface said it was not this way.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040301	Vera: This is the best you can do? Useless.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040302	Vera: By the time you finish, I would have killed all the enemies here, dear.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040303	Vanessa: Lower your voice. Don't draw other Corrupted here. They'll slow us down.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040304	Vera: Turns out that wherever I go, the battlefield always follows!	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040305	Vera: Hey, you can handle this, right? Little girl?	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040306	Bambinata: Yes. Combat order received from Mistress. Ready to fight at any minute.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040307	Vera: You guys suck.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040308	Vera: You're acting like this is your first mission!	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040309	Vera: Let me help you. Otherwise, I don't know when we can complete the mission.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040310	Vanessa: The mist is heavy.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040311	Bambinata: High percentage of sulfides, but lower than the harmful range.	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		1
1502040312	Vera: Something's on the tree. Is it a Corrupted? No, the degree of corrosion is not right...	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040313	Vanessa: Bambinata, check with the terminal.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040314	Bambinata: Yes, Mistress.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040315	Bambinata: ...It's a broken experimental Construct. The module is not available now.	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		1
1502040316	Vanessa: This place looks like their cemetery...	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040317	Vanessa: Stay alert. We haven't finished all the enemies.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040318	Bambinata: ...Synchronizing kinetic module parameters...	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040319	Bambinata: Synchronizing resimulated special attack moves...	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040801	Vera: Hmph, a welcome party like this...	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040802	Vera: Trying to stall for time?	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040803	Vera: Is this place constructed just to play them around? This is too narrow.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040804	Vera: Have to slow down.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502040805	Vera: Footsteps...	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		1
1502040806	Vera: Let's have fun, shall we?	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]		1

1502041128	No... Someone will hate Bambinata for this.	[6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5]	100000909	1
1502041129	Be a good kid. The researcher also said this to Bambinata...	[5.5, 5.5, 5.5, 5.5]	100000910	1
1502041130	But, Bambinata also has something to say... May she?	[8.5, 8.5, 8.5, 8.5]	100000911	1
1502041131	Wanting to do it does not make it right.	[6.0, 6.0, 6.0, 6.0]	100000912	1
1502041132	...Is that so? How can Bambinata tell right from wrong?	[8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0]	100000913	1
1502041133	If silence is the worst answer, then what is the correct answer?	[6.0, 6.0, 6.0, 6.0]	100000914	1
1502041134	The answer to what?	[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]	100000915	1

1021022005	Lee is back to this place again... but will he be able to face the core this time?	[6.0, 6.0, 6.0, 6.0]		1
1021011900	A few hours after saving Liv...	[6.0, 6.0, 6.0, 6.0]		1
1021011901	Lee is out on a walk but still can't quiet his mind...	[6.0, 6.0, 6.0, 6.0]		1

1021012105	—The clock hands start to move forward.	[5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0]		1
1021012106	???: The answer is not here. You failed. We all failed...	[5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0]		1
1021012107	Attempt 231... I saw... the broken wings... and the feathers fell into the snow and mud...	[5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0]		1

1502061128	Noctis: These bottles... Is it gas?	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
1502061129	Noctis: There's oil on the packaging. It's for food. They must have been here for a while.	[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]		1
