1550312	1551003	1	1	8	Dragontoll's Secret 12	"Pulao often requires herself to act like a ""grown-up,"" but sometimes she seems to unconsciously reveal the child aspect of her when she is with the Babylonia commandant."		Affection <color=#C14F38>8</color>	
1050401	1051004	1	1	2	Starfarer's Secret 1	"Nanami has planned a large number of adornments for her new frame, but because she has to travel in the data ocean, she made adjustments after Gestalt said they ""take up valuable processing power."""		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>

1050404	1051004	1	1	3	Starfarer's Secret 4	Nanami loves to test the limit of Power's strength. Knowing that, the Engineering Force often challenges Nanami to get Power to cut materials that are normally hard to obtain.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1050405	1051004	1	1	4	Starfarer's Secret 5	Nanami loves the elevated view she gets on top of Power, but sometimes she will get too excited and forget Babylonia's height limit, hitting her head.		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>

1560302	1561003	1	1	2	Starveil's Secret 2	Back in the early days when she was free from control, Haicma was struggling to distinguish between human legends and historical facts. As a result, it often appeared to her that mankind had experienced a significant physical decline, such as a loss of the ability to shoot fireballs from their palms.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1560303	1561003	1	1	3	Starveil's Secret 3	"Haicma knows a technique called ""divination"" in which humans foretell the future with card arrangements; however, even with all of her computing power, she cannot prove its validity."		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1560304	1561003	1	1	3	Starveil's Secret 4	"Haicma's old-fashioned hat was originally worn to cover up a damaged component, but she decided to keep it even after the component was mended. It has become her routine to clean and repair this hat, and the reason for it is that a gear covering her head makes her feel ""secure."" She values the emotional connection brought by a particular item more than its necessity."		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1560305	1561003	1	1	4	Starveil's Secret 5	"Haicma excels in making puns, and she will explain her puns whenever necessary. The statement ""excels in making puns"" is based on the fact that she has a success rate of 89% in making her listeners laugh, which is truly impressive even though more than 50% of successful cases are not due to the pun itself."		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1560306	1561003	1	1	4	Starveil's Secret 6	Haicma's composed exterior can be deceiving at times because she can maintain an impassive expression even when a storm is raging in her mind.		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1560307	1561003	1	1	5	Starveil's Secret 7	Haicma's thinking is the result of precise calculations. Therefore, she often feels perplexed when a situation exceeds her expectations, but this is not a kind of feeling she hates.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1560308	1561003	1	1	5	Starveil's Secret 8	At first, Haicma wielded her scythe strictly adhering to the tactical movements in her database that include many subtleties like the angles and amount of force applied; yet, she soon discovered that adding certain variations to the tactical movements could increase combat efficiency by nearly 20%... It took a long time before she recovered from such an astonishment.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1560309	1561003	1	1	6	Starveil's Secret 9	Haicma's database contains a wealth of information on domestic services, which theoretically qualifies her as an expert in child care. But when it comes to real life, she has failed a lot due to her over-reliance on those theories.		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>

1560312	1561003	1	1	8	Starveil's Secret 12	Haicma's frame was prepared by a researcher. Because she obtained this frame without knowing it at all, she has yet to fully understand its every function. For example, she just discovered that she can pull a never-ending string of colorful flags out from the joints of her arms.		Affection <color=#C14F38>8</color>	
1070401	1071004	1	1	2	Scire's Secret 1	At the beginning of the modification, she didn't expect Kurono would accept all her outrageous demands. And as a result, the backup plan she prepared was never used.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1070402	1071004	1	1	2	Scire's Secret 2	The only design proposal rejected was the one created based on her personal preference—an Inver-Device that is twice as large as the current one. The argument was settled with Karenina's compromise, after the person showed her a scenario where the wearer had to crouch down to pass through the doorway after installing the Inver-Device.

1070403	1071004	1	1	3	Scire's Secret 3	Members of the Engineering Force can hear their captain and vice-captain arguing almost every day.

1070404	1071004	1	1	3	Scire's Secret 4	Even in Babylonia, people like Karenina who have pursued education after becoming Constructs were very rare, not to mention that she graduated with the highest score among all students in her major.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1070405	1071004	1	1	4	Scire's Secret 5	"During her study, Karenina tried learning musical instruments and eventually chose to learn the drums.

1070406	1071004	1	1	4	Scire's Secret 6	To adapt to the new combat style, Karenina has to go through high-intensity zero-gravity and hyper-gravity training every day. The biggest struggle to overcome is to avoid being hit by her two ponytails in the face during the spin.		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1070407	1071004	1	1	5	Scire's Secret 7	"The Blast Hammer was intentionally designed to retain the capability of launching projectiles, so that Karenina can still ""bring back her good old days"" from time to time. As her shooting targets are usually the ruins that need to be demolished, this leisure activity of hers has actually saved a large amount of money that would otherwise be spent on demolition machinery."		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1070408	1071004	1	1	5	Scire's Secret 8	Due to the slight difference between the simulated gravity on the Moon and Babylonia, Karenina often hit the ceiling for exerting too much force when she first arrived on the Moon.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1070409	1071004	1	1	6	Scire's Secret 9	When Karenina was back to Babylonia, it took her some time to get used to the simulated gravity there. She acted gently even when walking. Surprised by her overly delicate movements, members suggested her to get more rest.		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1070410	1071004	1	1	6	Scire's Secret 10	For a long time, Karenina didn't understand why people kept looking at the top of her head while talking to her, until the Gray Raven Commandant explained that her Inver-Device shook back and forth when she talked.		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1070411	1071004	1	1	7	Scire's Secret 11	"Karenina seems to become more ""candid"" than before. When Bianca pointed this out with relief, Karenina explained that it was only a self-abandonment behavior because she couldn't turn off the emotional perception function of her Inver-Device."

1570302	1571003	1	1	2	Arca's Secret 2	He once left a manga in City 075 in order to make room for supplies in his bag.

Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1570303	1571003	1	1	3	Arca's Secret 3	Noan still dreams of his past from time to time. Now he can become aware of the dream and wake up, because the clockwork firefly is always intact in the dream.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1570304	1571003	1	1	3	Arca's Secret 4	He has lost count of the skills he learned in the past in order to survive. There is one thing he isn't good at, though, which is cooking. That's because he didn't have the chance to cook before he became a Construct. Now he can make decent food as long as there is a recipe to follow. Sometimes he still tries to eat the offcut ingredients, because he thinks throwing them away is a waste.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1570305	1571003	1	1	4	Arca's Secret 5	"Whenever he doesn't know what to say, he'd start to tell weird jokes with a perfectly straight face. Most of the time people think he is being serious, because he definitely looks it. Before he begins, Noan would always say ""Let me tell you a secret."" If the listener takes it, though, he'll start to explain. That is, if he still has the chance."		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1570306	1571003	1	1	4	Arca's Secret 6	His comrades from the Cargo Crew used to say he was very good at consoling people. As a result, he was often asked to talk with others over a drink. Noan doesn't drink. He doesn't even like the smell of alcohol and tobacco. Still, he won't leave someone who needs help and company alone.		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1570307	1571003	1	1	5	Arca's Secret 7	He doesn't know how to react to tears, nor can he tell if someone is faking crying. Whenever someone cries, he gets very nervous, even though he manages to maintain a straight face. He also tends to say yes to things he usually wouldn't at such times.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1570308	1571003	1	1	5	Arca's Secret 8	If there is an afterlife, Noan wants to be a seagull. Actually, he had never seen the sea or a seagull before he became a Construct.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1570309	1571003	1	1	6	Arca's Secret 9	"He was known to be a stubborn kid on Commoner Carriage N before the age of thirteen. A few reckless rebellions earned him the nickname ""prickly chestnut"" behind his back. However, since he never had the chance to see chestnut shells or anyone getting injured from picking chestnuts, he didn't realize the nickname was meant for him at all."		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1570310	1571003	1	1	6	Arca's Secret 10	Noan doesn't really have a preference for colors, but he does like things that are white and pure, like white fabrics, white feathers, clouds on a sunny day, clean paper... The only white thing he doesn't like is snow, especially a snowy field that stretches beyond the horizon.		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1570311	1571003	1	1	7	Arca's Secret 11	He has a friendly personality. He used to have a lot of friends when he was a human, but only really connected with a few of them. He tends to be slow and reluctant to react to people. Most of the time he won't open up until he has known someone for a long while. He'll only want to get closer to someone when he becomes familiar with them.		Affection <color=#C14F38>7</color>	
1570312	1571003	1	1	8	Arca's Secret 12	He tells his true feelings to those who he feels close to. When he realizes that certain things he says will cause them to react in a funny way, he'd occasionally make fun of them on purpose. He is aware that he is still a kid deep inside, but he doesn't intend to pretend otherwise in front of his friends.		Affection <color=#C14F38>8</color>	
1040401	1041004	1	1	2	Stigmata's Secret 1	Because Stigmata's appearance and specifications are much different from Zero's, when Bianca first appeared before the Purifying Force in this frame, some members did not even recognize her as their captain.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1040402	1041004	1	1	2	Stigmata's Secret 2	"When Bianca was appointed as the captain of the Purifying Force, most of the members were displeased. But after she ""courteously"" invited all members to spend one day with her in the training room, all doubts and gloom disappeared as if they had never existed."		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1040403	1041004	1	1	3	Stigmata's Secret 3	Fond of reading and studying literature, Bianca once had an enthusiasm for creating a movie script sparked in her mind. However, it quickly cooled off when she could not think up a name for her movie. To this day, that ambition still resides in a little corner of her heart.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1040404	1041004	1	1	3	Stigmata's Secret 4	"Chiko once said that Bianca ""has ferocious aggressiveness deep within her heart."" It left Bianca completely bewildered, but no matter how hard she pressed for an explanation, Chiko never revealed the reasons behind her judgment."		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1040405	1041004	1	1	4	Stigmata's Secret 5	The head-mounted Inver-Device is specially devised to operate with the Phantom Tracer, which can most accurately detect and capture the Punishing Virus residuals. Although it appears to have rotatable joints, it actually cannot be rotated.		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1040406	1041004	1	1	4	Stigmata's Secret 6	"In order to enhance the ""lamp-like"" feeling, the Phantom Tracer is equipped with a lighting function. However, because Mother's tissue sealed inside will also emit an apparitional light when this function is activated, Bianca has avoided using it to prevent unnecessary anxiety."		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1040407	1041004	1	1	5	Stigmata's Secret 7	Bianca's biggest interest is watching movies. There are even display cabinets in her personal dorm specifically for classic literary movie discs that she spent most of her salary on. After switching into Stigmata, she has become hooked on knight-themed fantasy movies from the Golden Age.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1040408	1041004	1	1	5	Stigmata's Secret 8	"The Swordstaff was originally called ""Black Excalibur"" in its designer's personal file before being finalized as ""Hecate"". As it was too different from Bianca's style, Bianca rejected it once it was proposed."		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1040409	1041004	1	1	6	Stigmata's Secret 9	Perhaps not many people noticed it, but Bianca and Chiko were actually good friends. They once went to the movies together on their day off in Babylonia, but had a big disagreement over whether to watch a romance or a spy movie.		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1040410	1041004	1	1	6	Stigmata's Secret 10	"Bianca was once ridiculed as a ""half-baked captain"" within the Purifying Force. In order to fortify Bianca's leadership, Chiko did many things with great effort behind the scenes, but the two of them never spoke about it even though Bianca was aware of what Chiko had done."		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1040411	1041004	1	1	7	Stigmata's Secret 11	Karenina once strongly demanded an investigation into the structural and safety issues of the Phantom Tracer as she was concerned that it would inflict irreversible damage on Bianca's M.I.N.D. After facing repeated harsh rejections from Kurono, Bianca spent a long time reassuring Karenina not to worry about her.		Affection <color=#C14F38>7</color>	
1040412	1041004	1	1	8	Stigmata's Secret 12	Due to the different natures of the Purifying Force and the Task Force, Bianca did not share much time with the commandant of Gray Raven. Naturally, before their first Deep M.I.N.D. connection, Gray Raven's commandant was worried that their connection would be unstable, but it turned out they achieved a high and stable sync rate every time they established a Deep M.I.N.D. connection.		Affection <color=#C14F38>8</color>

1230203	1231002	1	1	3	Vitrum's Secret 3	Bambinata occasionally had some strange memory fragments about Vanessa in her sleep. Out of curiosity, she once kept simple notes about them in her personal terminal. But perhaps she forgot about the file, the last edit history was almost a hundred days ago.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1230204	1231002	1	1	3	Vitrum's Secret 4	Actually, Bambinata is good at noticing others' emotions but will only react to her mistress or the people her mistress cares about.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>

1230206	1231002	1	1	4	Vitrum's Secret 6	On her way back from a mission to rescue a trapped WGAA member, Bambinata's perfect reactions to classical music were noticed by the member. After landing, the WGAA member sent ten inquiry letters in a row to the Egret Squad to ask if Bambinata's interested in joining the classical dance performance.		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1230207	1231002	1	1	5	Vitrum's Secret 7	"The part that looks like a ""tail"" on the frame is created to keep Bambinata in balance. It was originally a black globe module but was eventually modified into this soft, beautiful design at the urging of Vanessa."		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1230208	1231002	1	1	5	Vitrum's Secret 8	Bambinata always thinks that her name was given by her mistress, but according to the records in her background check file, she seemed to have been given this name before being handed to Dr. Raymond.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1230209	1231002	1	1	6	Vitrum's Secret 9	Bambinata was once involved in a mission to protect a target in the Conservation Area on the surface. Nothing unexpected happened during the mission.

1230210	1231002	1	1	6	Vitrum's Secret 10	Bambinata once received an invitation from an anonymous sender in the Little League, but she didn't go to the address in the letter.		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>

1010401	1011004	1	1	2	Hyperreal's Secret 1	There are always staff and Constructs talking about Lee's new frame, as it looks vastly different from the old one, but Lee doesn't know that they are talking about him.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1010402	1011004	1	1	2	Hyperreal's Secret 2	Lee has developed the habit of working at night as he was required to do so by his old job. A few Constructs were scared by him at night during Lee's early days in Babylonia. He was even once known as the midnight ghost in the lounge.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1010403	1011004	1	1	3	Hyperreal's Secret 3	Lee was not interested in philosophy at all. However, after switching to the Hyperreal frame, he started to read books such as The Concept of Time and Being and Time and take notes.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1010404	1011004	1	1	3	Hyperreal's Secret 4	During his rest time, Lee will adjust weapons and the exoskeleton for the Gray Raven members based on their individual preferences. This is a responsibility he is reluctant to delegate, given his past experience of a mishap where the commandant suffered dislocation due to inaccurately positioned equipment that had been repaired by someone else.

1310204	1311002	1	1	3	Fulgor's Secret 4	The new frame has greatly enhanced the structural strength and direct combat ability but sacrificed some support units to maintain mobility. Yata spent a lot of time to get used to these changes.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1310205	1311002	1	1	4	Fulgor's Secret 5	"Each of the powered arms on Yata's back has a unique processor and can process 4 different tasks without affecting one other. ""They can manage their own business!"" —Yata once claimed proudly."		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>

Nanami had excitedly prepared a whole bunch of cute cartoon stickers for her new frame, but Haicma quickly stopped her, saying it might ""affect the image of the Sage... no, the Cardman Rider."""

1050502	1051005	1	1	2	Startrail's Secret 2	"The thrusters use a luminous material with a maximum brightness of over 20,000 nits. The other mechanoids call them ""little suns"" in private, and they can even flicker according to Nanami's mood when not in combat."		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1050503	1051005	1	1	3	Startrail's Secret 3	"""The higher a mechanoid's awakening level, the easier it is for humans to understand"" was once a widely accepted academic theory. This theory collapsed with Nanami's appearance—facing the highest-awakened mechanoid, let alone understanding, most humans can't even keep up with her thoughts."		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1050504	1051005	1	1	3	Startrail's Secret 4	"Experiments on the relationship between mechanoids and humans have shown that children find it easier to communicate with Nanami than adults; artists find it easier to follow Nanami's thoughts than researchers; and in all sample data, the Commandant received the highest ""Nanami Comprehension"" score..."

1050505	1051005	1	1	4	Startrail's Secret 5	"Other mechanoids once mistook the Shield Axe, with the sword inserted into the shield, for an electric guitar.

1050506	1051005	1	1	4	Startrail's Secret 6	"She still tiptoes when she gets measured. When Haicma asks, she often makes excuses like ""There's no gravity in space"" or ""I accidentally floated away."""		Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>	
1050507	1051005	1	1	5	Startrail's Secret 7	"At the strong recommendation of the other mechanoids, they once added an ""angel halo"" to the top of the new frame. But because Nanami moved around so much and her body swayed a lot, the halo kept losing its grip and falling off, so Zavier had to give up on the idea."		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1050508	1051005	1	1	5	Startrail's Secret 8	"Although she's replaced her frame several times, changing her main weapon is a first for Nanami.

1050509	1051005	1	1	6	Startrail's Secret 9	"She brought a lot of comics, game cartridges, and Golden Age movies—a bunch of ""fun human stuff""—on the voyage.

1050510	1051005	1	1	6	Startrail's Secret 10	After boarding the Delorean, Nanami developed a habit of keeping a paper diary.

1320304	1321003	1	1	3	Parhelion's Secret 4	Ishmael tends to steer the conversation unconsciously to the direction she preconceives. She tried to avoid it but failed because she could always predict the intentions and responses of the other person.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>

1320311	1321003	1	1	7	Parhelion's Secret 11	Ishmael loves the sweet flavor as it is one of the few things she still remembers throughout the endless time. So, she specially kept the habit of eating and would add excessive amounts of sugar to her food.		Affection <color=#C14F38>7</color>	
1320312	1321003	1	1	8	Parhelion's Secret 12	"""If you compare me against who I was in this file, you can tell that I've changed a lot.

1330310	1331003	1	1	6	Daemonissa's Secret 10	"Lilith has a strong desire for strength, but this is out of her disgust with the fragile qualities of humanity, rather than a pure eagerness for power.

1530502	1531005	1	1	2	Pianissimo's Secret 2	Selena brought back many iris seeds from the ground and donated most of them to the greenhouse zone as precious samples for research.

1530503	1531005	1	1	3	Pianissimo's Secret 3	"When determining the development direction of her CUB, Selena expressed her expectation of having a design that could help her with her music creation. As a result, she got an audio CUB capable of sound wave attacks and playback named ""Snow Waltz"", which has already become one of her creators at her music studio."

1530504	1531005	1	1	3	Pianissimo's Secret 4	Selena got in touch with many things she had only seen in scripts and paintings during her time on Earth. Reality has thus become vivid in her heart.

1530507	1531005	1	1	5	Pianissimo's Secret 7	During her communications with Golden Age citizens, Selena has acquired a lot of local folk music that will never be included in any music textbooks and successfully made it to integrate suona into rock. However, judging from the reaction of the audience, it was a bit too experimental for them.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1530508	1531005	1	1	5	Pianissimo's Secret 8	"Selena restarted the Golden Age classic opera restoration project with Ayla. She also invited Leonie to help this time.

1530511	1531005	1	1	7	Pianissimo's Secret 11	Even though Selena is now out of the long cycle, she sometimes still has the nightmare of the commandant forgetting her again.

1340201	1341002	1	1	2	Daybreak's Secret 1	As a super AI, Jetavie consumes a lot of energy, so she is often low on battery. Believing that one can only work when fully charged, she pays extra attention to the Chosen One's diet.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1340202	1341002	1	1	2	Daybreak's Secret 2	Her concerns for others, especially those close to her, often manifest in stubborn and capricious ways. She might seem frivolous most of the time,  but she becomes extremely focused when someone dear to her is threatened, tackling problems in a logical, almost impassive way.		Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>	
1340203	1341002	1	1	3	Daybreak's Secret 3	"Jetavie was told that milk could make her grow taller when she was young, and she has had a fascination with milk ever since.

1340204	1341002	1	1	3	Daybreak's Secret 4	The Matrix includes the alpha and beta datasets, each with a different scenario preset—one where Jetavie awakens by herself after losing the Chosen One, the other where she awakens with the Chosen One by her side.		Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>	
1340205	1341002	1	1	4	Daybreak's Secret 5	"The alpha and beta datasets represent the different choices and actions Jetavie took in different environments, but there has only ever been one ""Jetavie"".

1340207	1341002	1	1	5	Daybreak's Secret 7	Jetavie's consciousness model almost collapsed upon creation due to excessive statistical dispersion, and she required a connection with the mother computer to stabilize it. To help with quick adjustments, the researcher who made her installed a simulated Inver-Device in her frame that could capture a human's Mind Beacon from afar. It is installed into the hair clips Jetavie uses to tie her ponytails.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>	
1340208	1341002	1	1	5	Daybreak's Secret 8	The surface of her tail is densely covered in multimodal sensors that allow her to sense and analyze the environment accurately. When the tail touches an object, it sends a high-frequency stimulus to her core processor, but this data is generally filtered out to avoid interference. When Jetavie is with people she is close to and comfortable with, the filter is disabled, causing her to feel bothered when the tail accidentally touches them.		Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>

The lights and broadcasting equipment in the commandant's lounge thus become the tail's playthings, often used to create ""unique"" virtual environments."		Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>	
1340211	1341002	1	1	7	Daybreak's Secret 11	Having lost the person closest to her in the Matrix, Jetavie had a deep sadness and regret inside her that she did not realize.

1340212	1341002	1	1	8	Daybreak's Secret 12	All the Chosen Ones gave all their computing power to Jetavie at the end of the trial, and the commandant lost all memories as the Chosen One. However, the data was kept inside Jetavie's memory, and it was replayed when the two had a Deep M.I.N.D. connection, reminding the commandant of the time when Jetavie grew up.
