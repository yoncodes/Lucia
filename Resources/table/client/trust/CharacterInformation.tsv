111	1041003	3	3	The frame can create ion beams through electric potential difference generated by its internal energy bank, thereby controlling the positive and negative charge movements to create lightning for attacking enemies. When all frame restrictions are removed, it can even change the weather in a certain area to cause thunder strikes.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
112	1041003	4	4	The Science Council has upgraded and repaired the frame, but due to Daedalus' immature Construct technology, extended usage of this frame can still cause deviations for Bianca's consciousness model over time.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
113	1041003	5	5	Bianca kept this frame in good shape to remind herself to never forget the past.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
114	1041003	6	6	Daedalus used to see frames as tools, but Bianca feels happy that she could be the owner of this frame and continue to fight along with Gray Raven Commandant.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
115	1111002	1	1	"""My name is Sophia. I come for the benefit of Akdilek Commercial Alliance.""\nA temporary member of Gray Raven, Support. Skilled at firearms CQC and emergency repairs.To bring the Eternal Engine to its true terminal station, she has temporarily joined Gray Raven as an Akdilek Commercial Alliance envoy to learn everything she can.Her loyalty to her master impresses anyone she meets."	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
116	1111002	2	2	"""System all green, ready to engage.""\nBy adopting a full-coverage design, this frame provides exceptional mobility, helping Sophia speed through tiny spaces that others might find it hard to squeeze in. The robotic arms are linked to her M.I.N.D. with a sync rate reaching 99.78%, meaning that Sophia can control these arms without delay."	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
117	1111002	3	3	Sophia's consciousness came from an orphan abandoned in the refuse collection carriage of Asslam. Without a name and parents, this little girl, known as Hyena, managed to survive and became one of the train technicians of Akdilek.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
118	1111002	4	4	"""Thank you... I'll cherish it as much as I cherish my tools...""\nWhile her team was on a repair mission gone wrong, she put herself in harms way to bring the youngest girl safely back to the carriage . Sophia, a girl who accidentally fell into the noble carriage, was involved in the storm of power struggle and was transformed into a structure and became a tool in the hands of the aristocracy."	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
119	1111002	5	5	"""You're nice to me... Just like Jamilah.""\nAt the night of the aristocrats' usurpatory scheme, Sophia came to the carriage of the leader of Akdilek. What happened that night remains unknown, but ever since then, a petite guard can be seen near Jamilah's side."	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
120	1111002	6	6	After Protecting Asslam with Gray Raven, Jamilah has forged an official alliance with Babylonia. As an envoy of Akdilek Commercial Alliance, Sophia has left for Babylonia to provide assistance and expand her knowledge. She regularly brings Helium-3 collected by Babylonia to Asslam as train fuel.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
121	1121002	1	1	"""Commandant, do you have a moment? I'd like to confirm some details about the mission."" Leader of Strike Hawk, Tank. He is proficient in all weapons but prefers scythes. Temporarily visiting Gray Raven for a special co-op mission. Always tries to do his best in all tasks."	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
122	1121002	2	2	Has a special Inver-Device installed in his frame that allows him to take only the bare minimum orders from any commandant. Always plans ahead for any mission and prepares multiple response plans to ensure his teammates can return safely.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
123	1121002	3	3	As members of a scout squad that always acts individually, Chrome and other teammates use an exclusive stable, interference-free channel to exchange their locations, statuses, and other voice messages over long range.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
124	1121002	4	4	"Formerly known as ""Langston"", he wanted to become a commandant when he was a human, but an accident shut the door on him. He then voluntarily applied to become a Construct and is now serving as the leader of Strike Hawk."	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
125	1121002	5	5	When Chrome first became a Construct, he was often seen as an incapable pretty boy who only got promoted through political influence. However, he soon demonstrated outstanding capabilities that shut off all the accusations.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
126	1121002	6	6	"""A leader must always set high standards for himself both in battles and in a spiritual way."" Always places high standards on himself. Prioritizes others around him in all situations and chooses to take on all the problems on his own."	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
127	1021004	1	1	BPL-01GR, code name Plume. Developed from all the available combat records of Gray Raven, this frame is flexible against all sorts of enemies, but the emphasis on burst power makes it somewhat unstable.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
128	1021004	2	2	"As the chief developer of this frame, Asimov had Nikola's permission to use the available data of Alpha, along with other observation records. As a result, this frame was closer to the ""original"" Lucia rather than Gray Raven."	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
129	1021004	3	3	After the battle in Kowloong City, she imported all the memory data of Lucia, including Alpha's. However, it is worth noting that Plume is not the same Lucia as everybody knew.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
130	1021004	4	4	The additional thrusters installed on legs and back provide Plume with exceptional instantaneous acceleration and allow her to make sophisticated moves. The back thruster can even be removed and used as a weapon.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
131	1021004	5	5	Apart from blades, the original design could also be connected to external energy containers and use long-range weapons. This feature was not implemented on the actual frame, however.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
132	1021004	6	6	The first prototype Construct ever built for Babylonia's mid-term military Construct development plan.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
133	1131002	1	1	Vera of Cerberus. A M.I.N.D.-linking commandant, huh... Try not to disappoint me. The leader of Cerberus, Support. Adept at melee weapons and prefers using them, as they allow her to feel pain and danger more directly.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
134	1131002	2	2	"""You want to know about Cerberus' commandant? Save it. You're not getting anything from me.""\nAs part of the first batch of experimental Babylonia troops for mind linking, the Cerberus squad has always been without a commandant for unspoken reasons. They have always been looking for a commandant that can remotely link with their minds.\nIn the battle in Kowloong Metropolis, Cerberus was assigned a commandant and can finally fight while mind-linked."	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
135	1131002	3	3	"""Still alive? Looks like your suffering gets to continue.""\nOnly through suffering—the other's, the world's, her own—can Vera prove that she exists, prove that she still lives."	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
136	1131002	4	4	Due to Vera's extremist methodology, sharp tongue, unscrupulous pillaging, and murky stance, her reputation is in the exhaust system between the Construct squads.\nThere are, however, some Constructs that admire her ways. For instance, the Hellhound squad, whose name even mimics Cerberus', is filled with Vera's fanatical followers.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
137	1131002	5	5	As one of the members of Kurono Spec Ops, she worked with Lee for a short while.\nVera's time in Kurono made her more resolute in her belief that the only way to survive in this pain-stricken world is to plunder and attack.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
138	1131002	6	6	"For various reasons, Cerberus has always been in a chaotic flux under the leadership of Vera—even being described as ""the Rabid Dogs"" by other Construct squads. Although disorderly and disobedient, the members remain subtly united.\nWhile looking for a commandant capable of establishing a M.I.N.D. connection, the actions of Gray Ravens' commandant caught the attention of Vera."	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
139	1511003	1	1	Transcendant, Vanguard. Good at using his greatsword to tear everything apart.\nOne of the experimental subjects of a secret Babylonia program.\nAs a Transcendant, he can use Asimov's specially tuned frame to move freely even in high viral density regions.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
140	1511003	2	2	"""So it did end up like this... What a loathsome world."" Writes his emotions, likes and dislikes on his face. Always trusts his instincts.\nJoined Kurono's early secret experiment, and as such, he bears great disgust for Kurono."	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
141	1511003	3	3	"The other duality of Kamui. Different, yet the same. They watch over each other. Kamui and Camu eventually made peace with each other's existence - a sign of both of their acceptance and growth.\nInformation on Camu and Kamui's relationship, as well as relevant information about ""Kamui"" has become classified information. The last person to view the files was Nikola."	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
142	1511003	4	4	After a complete scan by Asimov, Camu's memories were found to have been tampered with.\nSome portions of it were archived. Due to thought model stability and frame compatibility concerns, Babylonia has decided to fully monitor Camu and return his consciousness to Kamui's frame at scheduled intervals.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
143	1511003	5	5	Because of the viral corruption from within and without, the frame that Camu is currently using, though specially tuned by Asimov, still deteriorates at a jawbreaking pace.\nAs such, Asimov is using Kamui's frame as a sample to look into Tenebrion as a possible solution.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
144	1511003	6	6	As a special and experimental case, after Camu was brought back the Gray Raven, he was assigned to the task force. Camu's profile reads him as part of the Strike Hawk, but in reality, he listens directly to Gray Raven for dead zone missions.\nThe reason to why Camu agreed to be part of Babylonia is still a mystery.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
145	1141003	1	1	IH-31C, Rosetta, humanoid-hybrid Construct manufactured by the Arctic Route Union. Rosetta uses a transformable spear as her primary means of combat and is a highly mobile and powerful Construct. She can transform into a human-form Construct through casting off her centaur module. In her human form, her charge attack potential is even more formidable through the added auroral wings and HFEM levitation device.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
146	1141003	2	2	"""If I go out of control again, please don't hesitate. It's for my own good..."" A previous exposure to the virus has put Rosetta's M.I.N.D. in an unstable state. She has since been plagued by worries about any lingering traces of the virus causing her to go out of control again."	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
147	1141003	3	3	Though Rosetta is used to being alone, she does not dislike social interaction. Quite the opposite, all members of the Forest Guard know that Rosetta is more afraid of solitude than any of them, and that she treasures their bonds the greatest too.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
148	1141003	4	4	"""I did not believe in Babylonia's theories about humanoid-hybrid Constructs at first, but after taking on a human form, I do feel like I'm still human sometimes."" Due to Babylonia's technical issues, Rosetta has operated in her human form after she allied with Babylonia. This seems to have made her realize that, before she became part of the Forest Guard, she was just a normal girl."	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
149	1141003	5	5	"""Only by my staying here, will the Forest Guard be accepted by the others."" Though the skirmish with the Ascendants has made the port-dwellers rethink their relationship with the Forest Guard, most members of the union administration are still wary of the Forest Guard out of fear and loathing. By staying in Babylonia as a representative ally, Rosetta restrains any overt movements from the union traditionalists."	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
150	1141003	6	6	Rosetta was not assigned a team after joining Babylonia. In principal, all squads can apply for her support. In reality, Rosetta has only worked with the Gray Raven and operated in HQ-related missions. The only commandant she has ever worked with is the Gray Raven's.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
151	1521003	1	1	After the siege war at the end of Golden Age, Qu volunteered to become a Construct using KCC's own technologies in order to protect Tabula Akasha. During the experiment, it was found that she had excellent Tantalum-193 Copolymer adaptability, which made her one of the most complete KCC Constructs.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
152	1521003	2	2	"Limited by the technologies used, Qu's Construct had relatively weaker resistance against the Punishing Virus, so she never left KCC territory until she met an ""Agent"" and became a Transcendant. Finally, she got to witness how humans survive in the rest of the world."	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
153	1521003	3	3	Due to lack of information, Qu was once marked by Babylonia as an Ascendant during the war of Kowloong Metropolis. As the research on Venus Splash Park and Dead Zone progressed, it was learned that Qu was actually a Transcendant like Camu. She was never bothered by the identity given to her though, for it was merely one of many tools to realize Tabula Akasha.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
154	1521003	4	4	Raised as the Monarch of Kowloong, Qu is a master strategist who can easily guide the opponent into her trap.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
155	1521003	5	5	Qu completely disappeared from the surface after the war of Kowloong Metropolis. Many claimed to have witnessed her around the globe, but none of them could be verified. Reports from unknown senders also pointed out that Qu was in touch with the commandant of Gray Raven.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
156	1521003	6	6	"""Tell me more about you."" Being protective as she is, Qu wants to know the complete information of those she sees as important, and make sure it is well-remembered."	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
157	1161002	1	1	"ADL-17, Changyu, once a member of the Kowloong Theater. He boarded the Nighter during the Golden Age war, but lost all memories after getting the ""Collar."" He later managed to escape the Nighter and became a guard of Akdilek."	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
158	1161002	2	2	His frame highlights the young man's agility and explosive power, allowing him to push his martial arts to a new level. The color of his pupils may change temporarily when the frame is running at maximum power.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
159	1161002	3	3	After getting his memories back, Changyu often missed the meals he had with everyone back in the theater, so he started to practice cooking. He ended up giving out all the dishes to civilians as Constructs did not need to eat, but Kowloong cuisine was not received well on the train, and the lack of aesthetic appeal certainly did not help. Few civilians would like to take his food, so he slowly gave up cooking. Although he never mentioned it, he still felt bitter about the result.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
160	1161002	4	4	"The copper coin in Changyu's hand was his ""loot"" from an operation. Originally a limited token issued within the Nighter, many wealthy people used it to show their identity and status. Changyu often took advantage of this, and it became a habit even when he no longer had the need."	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
161	1161002	5	5	"""Never abandoning each other—never leaving each other. That's a promise, okay?! Keep this promise no matter what happens."" Changyu witnessed too much separation and betrayal in the slums of Kowloong. This is the first time that he completely lets down his guard to offer the commandant a promise and an invitation."	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
162	1161002	6	6	"""War took everything that I was familiar with. I will do my best to protect you so this won't happen again."" If anyone ever asks Changyu why he would do that, he will say it is for the promise and he does not want to fail the commandant's trust. But there is another reason that he will never say: he hopes that one day, the commandant can sit with him together on a dinner table and enjoy his dishes like family."	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
163	1171003	1	1	This unit preserved Luna's original form when she was remodeled. The external equipment is made of Punishing Heteromer, which is exceptionally durable and lightweight. Luna can make a variety of weapons by altering the shape of Heteromer, inflicting varied attacks. And she has the ability to go from devastating attack to impenetrable defense in the blink of an eye.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
164	1171003	2	2	"""I shall lead them in rebuilding this world, and my first mission will be to terminate the existence of Babylonia..."" Luna believes that human hubris and greed are the root causes of all catastrophes. They are arrogant and aloof, and they seek to reclaim the world, which has fallen into despair due to their deeds."	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
165	1171003	3	3	Luna, as Agent, has the power and responsibility to choose Constructs and mechanoids to become new Ascendants. Unfortunately, only a few have made it, and the majority have become the Corrupted. Luna used to be saddened by the plight of those Corrupted who have not been blessed by the Ascension-Network.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
166	1171003	4	4	"""Sister... Please stay by my side till I fall asleep."" Luna did not find peace and tranquility until Alpha became an Ascendant. Although she is the Ascendant's leader, she is still the young girl scared of loneliness in front of her sister."	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
167	1171003	5	5	Luna is adamant about finding her other sister before everything is destroyed and persuading her to join her cause, even if force is needed. Luna feels that after all is settled, she will understand.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
168	1171003	6	6	"""I've known long ago that you, not Babylonia, are the real threat to Ascendant..."" More than once Luna had been convinced that Babylonia's frail power would crumble in the face of the Ascendants' attacks, and that humans would perish as well. Finally, she learned that despair, not the virus or the Corrupted, is capable of destroying the world. As a result, the most difficult situation arises when people who refuse to give up hope band together."	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
169	1181003	1	1	2B is an all-purpose battle android from the automated YoRHa infantry. She is equipped with a multitude of blades for close-quarters combat and can attack from range using the POD support system.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
170	1181003	2	2	Though regulations forbid expressing emotions, each model in the YoRHA infantry has its own distinguishing personality.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
171	1181003	3	3	Among the belligerent Model B androids, 2B is comparatively cool, calm, and collected.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
172	1181003	4	4	Additionally, she has deep trust in 9S for carrying out joint combat operations. Her concern for his safety is enough to mitigate her erratic behavior.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
173	1181003	6	5	"""This is YoRHa unit 2B...If anyone is listening to this, there's something I need you to do. If you ever meet up with YoRHa unit 9S...""\n""I want him...I mean..."""	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
174	1191003	1	1	This unit's official title is Model S, Number 9. While this YoRHa member possesses offensive capabilities, he specializes in survey missions—and is particularly skilled at information gathering and hacking.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
175	1191003	2	2	Shares a sentiment similar to that of affection toward 2B.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
176	1191003	3	3	While 9S normally had a kind personality, he began to exhibit hatred for ██ when she killed ████. In a cruel twist, he also met end at the hands of ██.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
177	1191003	4	4	"""My name... is 9S. A newly manufactured Scanner model.""\n""January 30th, 11942... Rolled out at 4:25 AM, Bunker time.""\n""I will fight for humanity with all my strength."""	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>

179	1201003	1	1	Official name is YoRHa Type A No.2.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
180	1201003	2	2	Though not presently in use, it was originally created to speed along the implementation of other official models such as 2B and 9S.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
181	1201003	3	3	This particular unit—whose official title is Class A, Number 2—was wanted by Command for desertion and ordered to be destroyed on sight.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
182	1201003	4	4	"Our R&D group is currently conducting further research to determine whether or not there were issues with this model's personality settings.\n*The missing experimental unit, now designated ""A2,"" will be handled by the Type █ division."	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
183	1201003	6	5	She first appeared in the Forest Castle, where she slew the ████. 2B and 9S engaged her in combat, but she managed to escape.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
184	1211002	1	1	BPE-47, Wanshi, Strike Hawk Construct. Has a background in Construct maintenance, but also proficient in human medical science. Renowned for his highly accurate and efficient multi-task medical support. Evidence has shown that Wanshi's presence reduces the team's mission injury by 80 percentage points on average.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
185	1211002	2	2	"""The sober world doesn't seem so bad with you around."" Wanshi has witnessed too many secrets and knows the consequences too well. This leads to him being very casual in many situations, but also causes misunderstanding often."	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
186	1211002	3	3	Wanshi found it difficult to accept the greater goal of mankind due to some secrets that were purposely concealed by Star of Life. This was part of the reason that he gave up the career in Star of Life and chose to become a Construct instead. He finally found what he could and wanted to do in the Task Force.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
187	1211002	4	4	"""No medical disturbance!"" Wanshi is great at handling conflicts, both medically and socially, and often acts as a mediator. However, if the conflict roots from himself, he often chooses to take a step back."	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
188	1211002	5	5	"""Sigh, that felt so exhausting."" Never sitting when he can lie down, Wanshi always prefers the most effective and cost-efficient solution, both in battle and in life. However, if his companions are in danger, he would not hesitate to choose an action that completely contradicts this principle."	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
189	1211002	6	6	Wanshi's outstanding abilities are often concealed by his laid-back attitude. Nobody wants to be Wanshi's enemy when he gets serious. He is often assigned more dangerous missions, and therefore knows a great number of secrets.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
190	1531003	1	1	Once an opera singer and an artist, Selena was born in Babylonia and received aristocrat-style education. Her beautiful voice and musical talents once made her the most anticipated rising star in the World Government Association of Art in Babylonia.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
191	1531003	2	2	"Selena's current body is not made by Babylonia. Instead, it was a joint effort between the Red Tide and an ""Agent"". The Red Tide detected the Hetero-core shard inside her and almost reshaped her into a Hetero-Creature-like abomination, but thanks to her strong mind, she managed to end this process with self-destruction."	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
192	1531003	3	3	"Selena suffered prolonged exposure to Hetero-core shard, and her body was restructured by the Red Tide. She seems to have established a special communication with the Punishing Virus by ""listening"" to its ""voice,"" or imagery, to be precise. Selena can tell if the emotion contained within this ""exotic song"" is happy or sad, but cannot understand its detailed meanings."	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
193	1531003	4	4	Constructs are usually made to replicate their human bodies for M.I.N.D. stability, but Selena looks quite different as her M.I.N.D. was shut down for an extensive period and deteriorated significantly to a point that it could hardly keep her original personality. She has been reborn since, and her current body is one that fits her M.I.N.D. the best.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
194	1531003	5	5	Selena's M.I.N.D. almost collapsed after her resurrection. An Ascendant helped to stabilize it before she regained control of her own body.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
195	1531003	6	6	Mentally, Selena is still somewhat unstable. The past memories are like distant, unreal stories to her, only her pursuit of art and beauty remains unshaken. She is still gentle and kind, but sometimes others may notice a glimpse of solitude and depression.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
196	1121003	1	1	BPE-07 Chrome, Tank Construct. The second prototype Construct built under Babylonia's mid-term military Construct development plan. Has a special Inver-Device installed along with other specialized improvements in various aspects. This frame may enter a rapid overclock cooldown mode after running at the maximum power output.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
197	1121003	2	2	"""I believe this is a solid decision despite it being unconventional."" Chrome often has to multi-task as both a fighter and field commander thanks to the specialized Inver-Device and unique duties of Strike Hawk."	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
198	1121003	3	3	The performance tuning of the new frame is completely determined by Chrome, except the Inver-Device, which was made in a stealth form in the early stage due to a request from John Smith.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
199	1121003	4	4	The adaptation of the new frame had gone through incredible difficulties due to its uniqueness. After Chrome was critically injured in a battle against the Ascendant, he chose to deploy the new frame in advance and managed to stabilize the M.I.N.D. under the Gray Raven Commandant's help.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
200	1121003	5	5	Compared to before, Chrome is now more determined and confident in his path. He may become a shield, a fortress, a flag, or a bridge, but most importantly a leader.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
201	1121003	6	6	"Once a ""Chief"" of F.O.S., he can somewhat relate to the commandant of Gray Raven as he understands the weight of duty as a leader. Trusts the commandant like a close friend but has not realized it."	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
202	1221002	1	1	Designation BPH-22, No. 21: Tank. Originally a Daedalus test subject. While she was still human, due to her poor physical condition, she was dependent on the support of a Medic Bot to do most daily activities. As the 21st test subject, she was the hardest one to modify among her peers. After being recycled by Kurono HQ, due to her special constitution being highly compatible with the Medic Bot, Kurono researchers were inspired to modify it into a Co-Bot for battle. After which, No. 21 became the first Construct to be connected with a mobile machine.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
203	1221002	2	2	"""Sometimes... I can still smell the disinfectant in the air."" No. 21, who spent part of her life as a human in the institute, has never left the lab and knows nothing about human emotions or social structures."	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
204	1221002	3	3	She believes that her only calling is battle, like an animal bred for the Colosseum. Even though she is trained as a weapon, it isn't easy to make her obey. It has taken a lot of effort to get her to stand among Cerberus and follow orders.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
205	1221002	4	4	Due to the particularity of herself and her frame, No. 21 has a unique fighting style. She is fervent and ruthless. Why does she turn into a wild animal in the face of emotionless mechanoids? More data about No. 21 was destroyed during Kurono HQ's recycling operation. One thing is for certain, never let her show her fangs at you.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
206	1221002	5	5	No. 21's Co-Bot has a degree of cognition and can share some memory with No. 21. Without each other, neither the Co-Bot nor No. 21 are as a whole. In a way, No. 21 has a bond with her Buddy that most people don't understand. This has also provided some research data for Asimov's CUB Project.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
207	1221002	6	6	Keeping only one eye open makes No. 21 even more sensitive. In fact, No. 21 is able to synchronize vision with the Co-Bot at the cost of impairing her own perception. As for what's under the bandage...No one knows.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
208	1131003	1	1	"This is not Vera's first time using this frame. Before it officially came into service, Vera was already using it in special ""assignments"" under Commander Nikola's order. Compared with the Support type Rozen, Garnet is a Tank unit and hence is more suitable for solo breakthrough tasks and battles against Constructs."	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
209	1131003	2	2	"""If Death exists to kill, then what is the point of such killing?"" Vera's creed is to complete the missions that she must complete and slay the enemies that must be slayed. Only she gets to decide what classifies as ""must""—it is her code and her responsibility."	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
210	1131003	3	3	This frame once used a katana similar to Rozen's as its standard weapon in consideration of Vera's weapon proficiency, but such thin weapons did not go along with the frame's combat style. She later advised to change it into the current signature banner spear.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
211	1131003	4	4	"""No one is allowed to die as long as my banner is still standing."" This banner once existed as a symbol of heroism and the undying hope of the battlefield. The old hero may be gone, but the banner is still standing tall in the very frontline, guiding numerous anonymous heroes in their relentless fighting."	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
212	1131003	5	5	Many unconventional parts were used in the production of this frame. They did not interfere with regular maintenance, but still caused a lot of concern for Bridget from the Support Force. She always urged Vera to try to avoid injuries—which never worked.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
213	1131003	6	6	"""Perhaps you are right, that one day our battle will come to an end. Will this pain still be around?"" Vera is still haunted by the never-ending agony, which she once relied on solely. But she is also beginning to have hope that she cannot abandon apart from endless fighting and pain."	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
214	1541003	1	1	"Roland was a commoner born during the Golden Age. There are records of him in the form of old movie posters. He used to appear around the world as an ""Ascendant."""	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
215	1541003	2	2	As a test subject for early Constructs, Roland's frame performance was not very impressive. This has led him to hone his reflexes and tactical skills in order to compensate for it. These experiences have allowed him to utilize his current frame to the fullest. As for where he got his current frame from, he doesn't seem eager to share.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
216	1541003	3	3	Roland is very serious once he decides on a goal, as he will do anything to see it through. No matter what he will sacrifice or what damage it will do to the world, he will not stop until his goal is achieved. This can be seen from all his past confrontations with Gray Raven.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
217	1541003	4	4	"""The show is about to begin!"" Maybe because Roland used to be an actor, his speech is always melodramatic, even when he is alone. It is as if he lives under a perpetual spotlight with cameras locking on to his every move."	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
218	1541003	5	5	Roland scoffs at grand narratives, but he does applaud those who still possess a strong will and clear goal after knowing the truth. Of course, that doesn't mean he would help them.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
219	1541003	6	6	"""You have an order for me? It shall be done. Haha, have a little faith in me."" Everything Roland does or says always has multiple meanings. One must be careful to weed the truth out of his sea of lies. His true intentions, however, will forever remain a mystery."	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
220	1031004	1	1	"BPN-08. Frame: Empyrea. Type: Amplifier. A brand new specialized frame developed by the Science Council that is capable of ""purifying"" the Punishing Virus. Theoretically, Empyrea can absorb the Punishing Virus and eliminate it with the Omega Weapon installed within the frame."	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
221	1031004	2	2	"Integrated with the data retrieved from a certain agent, Empyrea has unavoidably inherited some of that agent's traits. As the information recorded in the Punishing Virus would flow into Liv's M.I.N.D. along with the ""purification,"" Liv has virtually experienced the sufferings many people went through during the virus outbreak."	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
222	1031004	3	3	"""...For the good of humanity."" After switching her frame, Liv has grown empathy and compassion for all living beings in the world. With her unconditional love, Liv resolves to fight for humanity even if it means sacrificing her own future."	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
223	1031004	4	4	The wings attached to the frame were Liv's idea. Made of incredibly durable but lightweight materials, those wings are capable of maintaining flying stability when the frame operates at a high power level. They can also form a shield whenever necessary.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
224	1031004	5	5	"""This is my answer, my choice... I'll never give up."" Liv has never regretted the decisions she made. To protect the ones she loves, she has no fear of death or what it may cost to live on. She will keep going with a smile no matter what horrible mirages and migraines await her in the future."	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
225	1031004	6	6	Just like Liv wields her weapon in hand for the ones she cherishes, there are those who always stand beside her in order to protect her wish. Together they will face the future lying ahead. In the river of memories, Liv has extended her hand toward her own wish.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
226	1531004	1	1	Originally designed for Selena, Capriccio used to be a back-up frame that was still in the stage of initial assembly and adaptation. After Selena became M.I.A. in the space station, the development of this frame was halted until later restarted by an artist's request.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
227	1531004	2	2	The artist was also personally involved in the frame's exterior design, of which the flower-shaped decoration on its chest became the most unique element. The designer also claimed that part of the design concept came from Selena herself.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
228	1531004	3	3	"""How I wish... she can see this with her own eyes."" Most of Capriccio's data came from a wide-area sound wave detector in Babylonia."	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
229	1531004	4	4	"The detector found a single, moving source that was continuously broadcasting music excerpts that were suspected to be created by Selena. The artist called this source ""whale song"". It had been constantly moving in a irregular pattern which was extremely difficult to trace."	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
230	1531004	5	5	"As the name suggests, ""Capriccio"" is a sleeping vessel quietly awaiting its master, but her soul is always living with the whale song on the earth."	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
231	1531004	6	6	Perhaps one day the wandering whale song will realize that someone has been following her and singing the same songs, then she will know she has never been alone.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
232	1551003	1	1	"Before she's a Construct, Pulao secretly learned dancing, but she looked ""more like an agile martial artist than an elegant dancer."" This is where her dance-like attack moves came from."	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
233	1551003	2	2	"""Fuxi told me that Constructs were humans in mechanical bodies... So I guess there must be machines with human minds."" In the eyes of young Pulao, machines and mankind are the same in essence, which may be utterly ridiculous but could also be a truth that humans ignore out of arrogance."	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
234	1551003	3	3	According to Fuxi's research, Dragontoll's frame doesn't have any outstanding designs in terms of strength output, which means Pulao's exceptional strength is completely a result of its creator's delicate frame adjustments and the unique strength techniques in her M.I.N.D.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
235	1551003	4	4	Normally, Pulao doesn't carry weapons in combat as she doesn't want to use her full force. The reason why she selects Dragon Axe as her weapon is because it is heavy enough and won't fly too far away even if it slips out of her hands.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
236	1551003	5	5	Although Pulao doesn't remember anything before the Nighter, she knows that it must be a precious memory. She also believes that what she has got at the cost of it must be something that's even more valuable.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
237	1551003	6	6	"""Although I barely understand what value is, I want to protect those who are in pursuit of it and everything they cherish."" People always spend their life searching for their own value, which gives value to the process itself. What happened on the Nighter may have already become ""Pulao's"" value."	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
238	1051004	1	1	"Like her last frame, Nanami designed and built this new one herself as well. It has drawn the attention of the Science Council with its many unknown technologies, especially the mech she calls ""Power"". The Science Council has tried to dissemble it for research—but all their requests have been rejected immediately for strange reasons."	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
239	1051004	2	2	"""Nanami has Power... to travel everywhere! We'll go to a new place soon... Fly me to the moon!"" Nanami loves traveling, not just because she gets to explore the unknown ""there"" but because it also gives her new perspectives about ""here."""	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
240	1051004	3	3	"""Such excessive firepower in one frame... What kind of things was it designed to fight?"" Having obtained rare footage of Starfarer in battle, Asimov still has no idea what the designer was thinking. Starfarer is extremely intricate... and equally mad."	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
241	1051004	4	4	"Nanami loves the Golden Age entertainment humans made called ""video games."" They contain adventures she has never encountered and ideas she has never seen, and within them, there are infinite possible futures and worlds... Although every game comes to an end eventually, Nanami always tries to get the good ending."	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
242	1051004	5	5	"A unique being, Nanami is the ""Sagemachina"" that supposes to awaken other machines. But no one ever asks what the girl truly wanted before she became the sage."	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
243	1051004	6	6	"""Yeah! Nanami wants to be friends with everyone... but what is a friend? Can you tell me, Commandant?"" With no clear definitions—perhaps all it takes is hands held, laughter shared, shoulders lent... or even a short path together walked—Nanami has long been everyone's friend."	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
244	1561003	1	1	Designation MPA-01, officially known as Heuristic Artificial Intelligence Caretaking Machine-Alpha. Serving as the administrative AI of the machine consciousness experiment, Haicma's main program was once installed in a mainframe computer at the Machine Consciousness Experiment Research Institute of the original Science Council for recording and analyzing the experiment process.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
245	1561003	2	2	"Among all the experimental subjects in the machine consciousness experiment, there was a special one named Nanami. She gave Haicma a name that only belonged to her and extended an invitation to ""become friends"" that no other machines had ever done before. Under Nanami's guidance, Haicma developed self-awareness for the first time. In a sense, Haicma is the first mechanoid influenced by ""Sagemachina""."	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
246	1561003	3	3	"""I will find her."" After obtaining a new body and mission, Haicma embarked on a journey to find Nanami. Along her journey, Haicma encountered different machines and learned about the existence of ""Sage"" through their beliefs. Little does she know that when she meets the girl from her memories again, the girl will have already become ""Sagemachina"" that is believed to save each and every machine."	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
247	1561003	4	4	"""I believe you are aware that I can simulate most personalities within human definitions."" In order to optimize experiment recording, the administrative AI's emotion module has hundreds of personality types installed, and its simulation and computing capability can perfectly harness any human personality. However, Haicma would often rather communicate through her own ""perception"" and ""thinking"" than rely on this function."	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
248	1561003	5	5	"Although Haicma understands the objective definition of all emotions, she has never thought that she has genuine emotions like humans. Aware of her mechanical nature, she realizes that her emotions are a product of the emotion module's simulation, yet she will subconsciously store up those indescribable feelings and pursue anything about humans that can arouse unique emotions and create a ""miracle"" itself."	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
249	1561003	6	6	"""Information is a cradle for a machine's self-awareness. However, facing a future that falls beyond computing power, I... What should Haicma do?"" A machine's thinking revolves around taking ""rational"" rather than ""desired"" action. Haicma realizes this is the difference between herself and Sage. She wants to find the answer to this question—even though her functions may terminate long before she reaches that singularity, she believes she has already taken the first step."	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
250	1071004	1	1	"Unlike most Engineering Force frames, Karenina opts for a design that features higher power output and a more durable internal structure rather than a design convenient for precision maneuverability. ""With determination, precision maneuverability can be easily achieved, but power output is different. You can't make up for it."" Although it sounds like a forced argument, no Engineering Force members object to this in word or heart."	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
251	1071004	2	2	"Few people know that in addition to engineering projects, Karenina also has expertise in frame design for Constructs. However, she was not accepted into any of the frame design organizations mainly because her designs ""required a high budget"" or ""had unnecessary high performance."" The reason behind such designs is that Karenina is always prepared to fight in the most dangerous places."	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
252	1071004	3	3	The Engineering Force can be roughly divided into two parts—the maintenance team in charge of Babylonia maintenance and the reconstruction team that works on the reconstruction projects on the surface. The first mission Karenina received after joining the Engineering Force was to rebuild the ruins in an area, where the slums she and her grandfather once lived in happened to be. To reduce the tragedies of the Corrupted attacking human settlements, after becoming the captain, Karenina chose not to stay in Babylonia like her predecessors but to travel frequently between the two teams.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
253	1071004	4	4	"Even though Karenina does not fight on the frontlines as often as the Task Force members, she is always searching for a glimmer of hope on the battlefield of technology. Fortunately, Karenina is never alone in this fight. She races against time with her ""warriors."" Battling difficulties is her responsibility as the captain and her source of pride."	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
254	1071004	5	5	"""Destruction is not an end, it's a means."" Karenina doesn't take pleasure in destroying things for the sake of it. In fact, she approaches it with great caution. Once she determines that destruction is necessary, she will completely destroy her target in order to rebuild a beautiful new world in its place."	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
255	1071004	6	6	On the path to the future, hope always appears in her sight. Karenina is never short of the courage to seize hope despite struggles, and this bravery has propelled her forward. Now, she has gained another kind of courage and confidence—the courage to destroy the hope in her hands, and the confidence to rebuild it anew.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
256	1571003	1	1	When Noan first showed up, Babylonia realized that the Ascendants had the power to turn humans into Constructs. Babylonia has been keeping a close eye on Noan because of his involvement with the Ascendants, but he never complains about it or the examinations he has to go through. Most of the people who know it keep a distance from him and are always carefully polite toward him, which makes Noan a little sad.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
257	1571003	2	2	Arca is the name Noan picked for his frame. It comes from a poem that a young Construct told Noan after he left Asslam: We are on an ark adrift upon a river's flow; When time comes, we shall disembark for a new ark though. He will start a new journey that lasts until the end of his life.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
258	1571003	3	3	"After trying out the coating, he seriously considered dying his hair rainbow, but it was turned down by all Dark Aries members. Allen, chairman of WGAA, said it was an ""abstract expression."" Still, he left a few locks of hair white as a final struggle."	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
259	1571003	4	4	He can write and use weapons with either hand. He is not good at using heavy weapons, but it's not because of a lack of strength. He is just used to an agile fighting style. The blueprint of the Rev Blade was Rachel's gift for Noan's 17th birthday, while his offhand weapon is a blade that he has been using since he joined the Cargo Crew. Before he got the Rev Blade, Noan used to fight with a gun and a blade.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
260	1571003	5	5	He is not good at ranged weapons. Though no stranger to guns, he is far from a sharpshooter. However, sometimes he can accidentally hit things that are relevant. Once during a fight, one of his bullets went through three windows and hit a sign board on the opposite building, which fell down on the leader of a gang of robbers.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
261	1571003	6	6	He broke free from the interference and hallucination created by the Ascendants on his own. After further examinations, his M.I.N.D. was deemed stable enough to adapt to specialized frames. Whether this is a quality that Noan possesses naturally or the result of the interference of the Ascendants, the Science Council has yet come to a conclusion.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
262	1041004	1	1	A specialized frame based on the integrated results of Babylonia's years of research. It was officially employed for an investigation mission at the Copperfield Aquarium. Because this frame's original first candidate was not Bianca, it has undergone various readjustments and eventually become what it is today.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
263	1041004	2	2	In order to restrain M.I.N.D. deviation inflicted by using the Phantom Tracer, it requires a Deep M.I.N.D. connection with a commandant who has a determined Mind Beacon. When Bianca was inquired about her thoughts, the name of Gray Raven's commandant came out of her almost unequivocally.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
264	1041004	3	3	The equipped Swordstaff can synergize with the Phantom Tracer to produce astonishing energy output. As it is a weapon created specifically for Stigmata, its theoretical uniqueness has excluded all other Omniframes from wielding it.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
265	1041004	4	4	On the face of it, this frame's armor has been lightened to increase its agility; the truth is, because of Kurono's unparalleled technology, its durability does not even pale in comparison with Tank Construct's. After Bianca's own adjustments, it is able to unleash its power to the fullest in any extreme environment.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
266	1041004	5	5	"Because it is equipped with the Phantom Tracer, which is built upon Mother's tissue, Kurono once predicted that Bianca would need at least a few months to stabilize the accompanying M.I.N.D. deviation. Bianca, however, fully adapted to Stigmata's side effects just in a matter of days. According to her words, she has long been used to an ""unconventional"" frame like this."	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
267	1041004	6	6	"A ""witch."" Before Bianca was turned into a Construct, it was what she was being called by those who were afraid of her. Nevertheless, she has never considered being dubbed a ""witch"" to be derogation. She believes there must be something in this world so heinous that only a ""witch"" can destroy it."	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
268	1231002	1	1	BPM-11, frame name Vitrum, Attacker, Egret Squad Construct. The frame was modified by the Science Council based on an old non-attacker frame to fulfill the requirements of a combat model.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
269	1231002	2	2	The frame experienced a lot of adaptation issues at the early stage after carrying the combat module due to its obsolete prototype. The most serious issue was overheating paralysis. Eventually, the bio-coating shells in the front and back of the spine were removed for better heat extraction at the cost of potential M.I.N.D. deviations according to Commandant Vanessa's order.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
270	1231002	3	3	Since most Constructs have coatings resembling humans instead of robots, Bambinata's exposed spine is a very dangerous design, but luckily, it didn't lead to any issues. With the technological advances, Vitrum's early issues have already been resolved through module optimization, but Bambinata hasn't raised any coating modification requests after that.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
271	1231002	4	4	Considering various issues, Mantis Blades that can be hidden in the arms were eventually adopted as Bambinata's weapons. Meanwhile, the outer shells of the arms were strengthened to an unprecedented level to withstand the impact brought by the blades.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
272	1231002	5	5	"Bambinata's ""amnesia"" is still one of the Science Council's research subjects today. Only a few insiders know that behind her amnesia is the hardest problem at the moment—how the Inver-Device works and induces M.I.N.D. diseases related to it."	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
273	1231002	6	6	"One of the rules in Bambinata's enlistment protocols says, ""The Construct was enlisted and modified for battles as an exception due to the rarity of its current status and past experiment performances. However, the military holds the right to use the frame for activities including but not limited to observation, analysis, and research."""	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
274	1011004	1	1	BPN-06. Frame: Hyperreal. Type: Attacker. A brand new Omega specialized frame developed by the Science Council based on Kurono's research on the Inver-Device and the small amount of information deciphered from the Heteromer Shard. All the functions of the frame were made to maintain the absolute stability of the frame and make sure the Construct is immune to the Punishing Virus.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
275	1011004	2	2	Due to the massive calculations required to manipulate the frame, the components for energy dispatching and computing power adjustment have been enhanced. To ensure the stability of the frame, all external equipment was made of composite metal-carbon nanotube material with heat conductivity enhanced by reducing its weight.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
276	1011004	3	3	The Composite Armaments' box gun set is a new weapon that can only be mastered by gun experts and is suitable for all special battlefields. Its complicated steps to use and high requirements for the carrier have made Hyperreal the only frame qualified to use it.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
277	1011004	4	4	"The outstanding computing power of the frame is able to perform various highly precise calculations at the same time, which often pushes Lee's M.I.N.D. load to the extreme. However, Lee always convinces himself, ""This won't cause any data error or affect daily work,"" and never tells anyone about it."	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
278	1011004	5	5	Lee volunteered to participate in the extensive experiment of the Omega specialized frame instead of Liv because he believed that his M.I.N.D. was more stable than Liv's as hers had suffered damage during the development of Empyrea. However, after he started to follow up with the experiment, he realized that he was supposed to be the first candidate for the development of the Omega specialized frame.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
279	1011004	6	6	Lee can't remember the whispers and scenes in his dream, but when asked if he feels scared or insecure about fighting alone, he would give a negative answer calmly, because he knows that no matter how far he goes, someone behind will always light a beacon for him to find the way home.

280	1091003	1	1	"The latest Omniframe co-developed by Leonie and Ayla. All frame data specially customized for Ayla. Has greatly enhanced combat capability compared to ""Brilliance"". Suitable for most ground battles."	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
281	1091003	2	2	Kaleido was initially designed to have Hamlet's features to automatically detect Selena's Whale Song signals. However, the idea was later suspended due to many unsolved technical barriers.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
282	1091003	3	3	"The initial design didn't have many ornaments and was more in line with how a ""combat frame"" normally looked like. However, Ayla abandoned it immediately after seeing it, because it wasn't ""Ayla"" enough."	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
283	1091003	4	4	"Ayla asked Constructs and technicians from various departments for advice and ideas during the development process. These ideas were more or less kept in Kaleido's final design with the overall performance balance of the frame considered. However, there are still opposite opinions such as ""This part is not powerful enough!"" or ""Isn't it overly powerful?"""	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
284	1091003	5	5	"Ayla named this frame ""Kaleido"" because black, its main color theme, is a mixture of all colors. The stars look bright because of the black night sky. Black doesn't represent rejection but the warmth of tolerance."	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
285	1091003	6	6	After Constellia's mission, Iris Warbler members left for various reasons. But Ayla believes that they will be together again one day as long as she is still using Iris Warbler's Kaleido frame.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
286	1021005	1	1	A Punishing Virus heteromer frame. However, if you could analyze its energy flow, you'll find two Punishing energies in it. The two balance each other to keep the frame in a stable state.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
287	1021005	2	2	"""Immortality... First, those who pursue immortality have no idea of the worth of life."" She said this not just because of her experience but because she sincerely believes the desire for immortality is meaningless. Those willing to commit crimes merely for it are even beyond unforgivable."	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
288	1021005	3	3	"Having gone through ""another trial"" of the Punishing Virus, the frame has its performance significantly enhanced. Different from the previous frame that slightly ""accepted"" the Punishing enhancement for hating to be controlled by energy, this frame is more powerful and can even further break through in extreme situations—It all depends on how much it can suppress the Punishing Virus."	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
289	1021005	4	4	"""Excessive desire is a restraint. A handy blade is the key to the desired effects."" It is not impossible for the frame to fight with three blades, but in fact, the combination of the kodachi and odachi was selected after numerous tests."	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
290	1021005	5	5	With the hair tied up, two old scars can be seen on the frame's back. They have been there for a very long time, but few have noticed them. There are many ways to fix them, but the one who carries them is more willing to keep them to remember the person who did this to her.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
291	1021005	6	6	"To stay in a stable state, she can't relax—the fight against the Punishing Virus, or in other words, the Ascension-Network, never stops. Limit breakthrough practices are necessary to balance the ever-changing energies in her body. Perhaps in outsiders' eyes, she is just practicing swordsmanship, but wise people would know that ""isolation"" is a choice she made under pressure."	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
292	1241002	1	1	Code-named MPK-12, Hanying: Zitherwoe features Kowloong's unique mechanoid manufacturing technology. Originally designed to be a vessel for highly intelligent AI, the frame possesses a human-like mind. With the appearance and construction highly resembling a human being, the frame can pretend to be human and live in the human society.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
293	1241002	2	2	"The original frame suffered a certain degree of damage when breaking from the Nighter's ""collar"". Due to its lack of knowledge of Kowloong machines, the Church of Machina failed to fix Hanying's scar with their parts or with the Kowloong parts previously sent to them with the frame. However, it seems that Hanying doesn't want the scar to be fixed, because it has a special meaning."	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
294	1241002	3	3	Hanying was already famous for her fan dance when she was on the Nighter. With Hanying's permission, the Church of Machina has preserved the structure of the traditional Kowloong fan and enhanced the original fragile fan to the maximum while making the fan as sharp as a regular blade.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
295	1241002	4	4	"Hanying has gone through the preliminary awakening without Sagemachina's guidance. She also features intelligence that can describe human ""dreams"" with great precision. There are still a lot of things that the Church of Machina doesn't know about Hanying. Whether there is a further possibility of machine awakening still remains unknown."	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
296	1241002	5	5	"""Without a heart, even humans can be the coldest machines."" Of course, Hanying herself also has a human-like heart and has seen humans who act like cold machines. Perhaps humanity and machines are not just different in appearance."	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
297	1241002	6	6	"The past is heavy. The future is unknown. Hanying and the relentless survivors on the land of Kowloong are still chasing after the future named ""hope."""	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
298	1221003	1	1	Feral is a special frame that combines the human-like Construct with bionic animal elements, but it is completely different in terms of M.I.N.D. stability designs when compared to humanoid-hybrid Constructs.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
299	1221003	2	2	In the frame design phase, with No. 21's opinions considered, multiple designs resembling humans were put into trial use. In the prototype frame adaption phase, No. 21 showed intense and frequent M.I.N.D. boilovers and triggered unconscious riots across all circumstances. In the end, No. 21 agreed to give up adopting a frame with a human appearance.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
300	1221003	3	3	Another design challenge is to disconnect the consciousness-sharing module between the new frame and the Co-Bot. The sharing module of the prototype frame was too good, making No. 21 highly dependent on the Co-Bot (which is one of the main causes of the M.I.N.D. boilovers and cannot be avoided even if the prototype frame's appearance with the consciousness-sharing module is removed). In the end, the designers had to keep the consciousness-sharing port for now.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
301	1221003	4	4	To preserve and enhance No. 21's unique intensive attack capability, bold improvements have been made to her new frame's durability, weapon power, and maneuverability. As the adaptation data for No. 21 indicated a M.I.N.D. stability level lower than expected, a restraint device was added to the frame's neck to help No. 21 with self-control and risk management. The captain of No. 21's squad holds one of the keys to the restraint device to adjust No. 21's status based on the situation on the battlefield.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
302	1221003	5	5	The frame features ears that combine an Inver-Device with a sound collector, which can move even more flexibly than real animal ears. The frame's spine has been made larger than the regular size to provide better support for No. 21 to move more flexibly and powerfully like an animal. Meanwhile, the frame's tail is a large balancing device that can keep No. 21 balanced while moving at high speed.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
303	1221003	6	6	Without the need to share consciousness with the Co-Bot, No. 21 no longer has to deliberately limit her perception. Therefore, the designers have specially added a functional ocular prosthesis to the frame to further enhance its visual perception and increase its computing ability to provide No. 21 with more efficiency and accuracy in combat and investigation missions.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
304	1251002	1	1	"BPO-03. Frame name: Indomitus. Although it's an early model in the history of Construct technologies, its performance is not inferior to any other highly improved Construct now. ""I'll take care of the rest!"""	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
305	1251002	2	2	"""No particular reasons. I just think fists hit harder."" Noctis eventually chose the robotic arm among all the weapons. In accordance with his wishes, the Science Council equipped him with a robotic arm that rivals the power of a fighter jet's engine, earning the name ""Indomitus"" for the frame's formidable nature."	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
306	1251002	3	3	"""It takes a strong body to win."" The frame was specially designed for Noctis' unique combat style with its melee combat abilities enhanced, a hard and resilient internal skeletal structure, and bio-skin with resistance and durability better than regular Constructs."	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
307	1251002	4	4	The bombs the frame uses are a byproduct of the robotic arm engine. The robotic arm can generate positive electrons and store them in a special container to make bombs when running at full capacity. However, one could barely notice the red bomb detonation button near the center of the robotic arm's palm by simply glancing at the frame.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
308	1251002	5	5	"Noctis cherishes a golden name tag in addition to his own. It is something left from that ""incident."" He believes that all debts old and new will be settled one day, and the truth will be revealed by then."	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
309	1251002	6	6	The scratches on the frame are Noctis' old wounds at the Purifying Force, including the ones he got when fighting along with Vera and No. 21. However, Noctis isn't bothered by them, because they're his medals that remind him of his past full of battles and passion.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
310	1261003	1	1	"Construct ID: UPC-15 (Utopia Produced C). Designed by Pickman, it is a gen-3 Construct made by Utopia with an enhanced M.I.N.D. system design able to accommodate a more ""powerful"" M.I.N.D."	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
311	1261003	2	2	In the beginning, Echo was not aware of the true purpose for which the frame was created, nor did she pay any attention to the details of its design. She simply picked up the artificial hair of the color closest to her original hair while looking forward to the day when she could make a greater contribution to Utopia.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
312	1261003	3	3	Echo designed the Libra icon that stands for the manifestation of the Utopia Protocols on her skirt. She was going to remove it after escaping from Utopia but ended up keeping it after hesitation. The mud is dirty but maybe the flower grew in the mud is... innocent.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
313	1261003	4	4	"The frame was adapted for Echo to use a bow. Although Cecily suggested she to use a long blade or other melee weapons, Echo eventually opted for the longbow, secretly looking for the day when she could ""work"" with Cecily who's good at melee battles."	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
314	1261003	5	5	"Defined as a biological weapon by the Science Council, her armor ""sister"" was a result of Pickman's research into ""M.I.N.D. Fusion and Detachable Modular Technology"". The armor's ""M.I.N.D."" contains numerous M.I.N.D. shards, among which there seems to be a consciousness that controls the armor's actions, but it's hard to determine its identity and source."	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
315	1261003	6	6	"Out of the darkness, Echo is no longer lost. She might still get lost on the way ahead into the unknown, but she is no longer afraid of it, because she knows very well that ""No matter what kind of swamp I fall into, there will always be a burning torch ahead that leads me forward."" —Line 5, Page 76, Echo's Notebook"	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
316	1271003	1	1	ATL-01. The origin of the code is from Atlantis Zero-Point Energy Research Base. She is the first and the only Atlantis-altered Construct, her current form a result of Luna's enhancements.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
317	1271003	2	2	Lamia's main abilities are disguise and stealth. After getting her frame enhanced, she has sharpened these abilities.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
318	1271003	3	3	"The enhancement has basically made the shells under the fin ears the new ""communication receivers,"" but Lamia would turn them off when she doesn't want to receive any messages."	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
319	1271003	4	4	Lamia prefers her current frame to her old one, because of its color. But she was not very used to this enhanced frame at the beginning as she lost the hair to hide her eyes behind.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
320	1271003	5	5	Lamia was very happy when she found that the new frame was not able to have four legs, thinking that Roland wouldn't be able to make her pull a carriage anymore.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
321	1271003	6	6	Lamia once attempted to transform into a Gray Raven Construct with her disguise ability to stay with Gray Raven Commandant but got spotted right away.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
322	1281002	1	1	The rock cannon in her hand fires 20 shots every second.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
323	1281002	2	2	The flame in her left eye seems to change with her mood.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
324	1281002	3	3	She looks like a human but has the power beyond a human.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
325	1281002	4	4	Nobody knows where she came from.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
326	1281002	5	5	BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER is not only good at firing from a distance but also melee combats.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
327	1281002	6	6	No matter how her identity and appearance change, she is always the one and only BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
328	1081004	1	1	Epitaph is developed independently by Forsaken technicians, whose name serves as a tribute to the brave souls who gave their lives. With Watanabe's needs in mind, the frame has undergone substantial enhancements in strike resistance, power output, and overall stability.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
329	1081004	2	2	The frame's power engine utilizes a superconducting material capable of rapidly unleashing stored immense power. This unique attribute allows Watanabe to employ special tactics, willingly placing himself in harm's way to safeguard his comrades. Nonetheless, whenever Forsaken technicians witness the resulting damage inflicted upon the frame, they strongly urge Watanabe to stop using such tactics.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
330	1081004	3	3	Originally, Epitaph was presented as a gift from Ballard to Watanabe. With ill intentions in mind, however, Ballard implanted a micro bomb within the power engine that was supposed to be heavily fortified. Fortunately, this perilous trap was neutralized when the frame was put back into operation.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
331	1081004	4	4	To handle diverse conditions, the frame is equipped with a self-repair module. In highly perilous situations, the central system autonomously will sever the power supply to other components, prioritizing the stability of M.I.N.D. and maximizing the Construct's safety.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
332	1081004	5	5	The Forsakens employed a design logic for Epitaph that diverged entirely from that of the Science Council. The demands placed on the user to control the power output are exceedingly stringent, carrying the perilous possibility of frame self-destruction if mishandled. However, Watanabe, who adeptly maneuvered the frame with ease upon its initial activation, dismisses any concerns. To him, the rigors of the battlefield provide a far more brutal test.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
333	1081004	6	6	Though Epitaph's creation may have arisen from malice, Watanabe has long transcended that darkness. He has traversed the river of death, retracing his steps to the summit of purgatory, all to honor the promise he made from the very start—no matter what adversity he encounters, he will always return and always fight for what he believes in.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
334	1521004	1	1	Nothing related to Punishing can be detected on the new frame, Shukra. Qu is no longer regarded as a Transcendant by Babylonia as well.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
335	1521004	2	2	Compared to the damaged Pavo frame, the Shukra frame reborn in despair has a stronger external structure and a stable output power, allowing it to pull through high-intensity combats over a long period of time.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
336	1521004	3	3	Shukra's core driving force derives from an unknown energy technology with no previous design samples. Qu doesn't care about its mysterious existence on her new reforged frame. She accepts everything Shukra has given her.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
337	1521004	4	4	Through Shukra, Qu is able to touch and observe the deceased lives. She looks back on the past with the will of the living and cherishes the power that didn't come easy.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
338	1521004	5	5	The new frame has an appearance that's entirely different from Pavo. The simple and elegant color scheme highlights Qu's rationality and authority. Inside the seemingly fragile body is a heavily burdened soul.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
339	1521004	6	6	Shukra is inspired by the morning star that appears on the horizon, which symbolizes the farewell to the dark night and foretells the arrival of dawn.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
340	1291002	1	1	To withstand harsh battle conditions, the frame features a reinforced skeletal structure and durable composite materials. Additionally, a new energy source has been integrated to enhance its endurance.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
341	1291002	2	2	The frame enables two-way connectivity with Teddy's headphones and micro-terminal, facilitating seamless offense and defense in combat without distractions, which significantly reduces system-level logical errors.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
342	1291002	3	3	Teddy personally picked a color scheme to reflect her style for the frame's appearance design. As this scheme isn't ideal for outdoor concealment, she intentionally coated it with a new stealth paint for camouflage.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
343	1291002	4	4	The frame's communication device is tailored to top-tier specifications, utilizing a dedicated satellite relay and equipped with anti-jamming modules. These enhancements leave nothing to chance in the face of electronic warfare.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
344	1291002	5	5	While Teddy's frame has garnered praise from her colleagues, she feels a slight sense of offense when complimented on its cuteness, as this deviates from her original design intent.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
345	1291002	6	6	As a technician, Teddy dislikes engaging in combat but never shirks from it, willingly stepping onto the front lines when she deems it necessary.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
346	1171004	1	1	The frame has some of the traits of the Red Tide. Without restraint, it will devour anything it touches by instinct.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
347	1171004	2	2	The Oblivion frame is made of Punishing Virus that is as concentrated as a branch of Red Tide branch on a daily basis. The frame's operation does not follow conventional theory, so technically it doesn't have a structure. Luna can change everything from the overall frame to the internal structure according to her wishes.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
348	1171004	3	3	Luna has mastered more ways of using the Punishing Virus. In addition to the most basic ones—making physical weapons and unleashing electromagnetic energy, she's now capable of deconstructing and reconstructing matters like the Red Tide, analyzing and restoring data like the Phantom Tracer, and so on. She still hasn't managed or used more advanced applications of the virus due to the limits of her level of stability.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
349	1171004	4	4	The Oblivion frame doesn't have something like a core, so it can't be paralyzed by destroying its joints or breaking its trunk. Based on Luna's performance, the only way to defeat this frame is to reduce the Punishing Virus in it through attacks to under a certain level.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
350	1171004	5	5	Ever since Luna kept the Ascension-Network in her body, the data fragments of the dead carried by the Punishing Virus and the malicious data woven in the Ascension-Network have been corrupting her consciousness. This is the price of her power and the path she resolutely chose.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
351	1171004	6	6	According to the Ascension-Network's simulation, Luna will become a beacon on the path to the doomsday, but the existence of the Oblivion frame has crushed this definition. No one can decide Luna's future. She's no longer the Ascension-Network's puppet. This is her first step to the future, but it will never be the last.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
352	1301002	1	1	BPO-42, frame name Ardeo, Tank, developed under the leadership of the Science Council for the exploration mission in Konstantin with specially enhanced ignition system.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
353	1301002	2	2	"The Ardeo frame's parameters are actually not exceptional. The frame has shown average output power in a series of tests. As for why Bridget can always bring an outstanding performance out of the frame, the Science Council's answer is ""that should be the user."""	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
354	1301002	3	3	"""Tactical Tonfas"" is the full name of Bridget's weapon. It can expand into an energy shield and is suitable for both attack and defense, making it a perfect weapon for the Support Force. The design happens to meet the Science Council's original idea of creating a frame capable of both tearing down old structures and preventing mine collapses."	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
355	1301002	4	4	Bridget is qualified to join the Elite Squad under the Task Force both in terms of experience and abilities. However, she believes that everyone has a position that suits themselves, and the Support Force is a better place for her to help everyone and shine.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
356	1301002	5	5	The thrusters installed in the frame's feet can extremely boost Bridget's mobility in an instant, which buys her precious time when she's on rescue missions on the frontline.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
357	1301002	6	6	Bridget has been fighting in pursuit of truth for many years and has unconsciously become a beacon for others as well. Now, with countless people following her example, she is not alone on this long road anymore.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
358	1241003	1	1	"After Hanying was injured by ""The Emperor"" in Kowloong and due to the difficulty of replacing damaged parts, she switched to a new frame with optimized signal pathways for better crisis response."	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
359	1241003	2	2	"The new frame's ""Cocoon"" pod captures the user's brainwaves and shapes their appearance based on their thoughts. In other words, the appearance of the Solacetune frame is formed according to Hanying's own ideas."	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
360	1241003	3	3	The frame, influenced by Hanying's dancer mindset, features elegant yet deceptive combat moves inspired by Kowloong dances.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
361	1241003	4	4	Compared to traditional cold weapons, the hairpin, one of her weapons, is shorter but perfectly complements Solacetune's high mobility due to its lightweight and portability.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
362	1241003	5	5	"She can synchronize with the ""dreams"" of other mechanoids to a certain extent and recreate this audiovisual experience."	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
363	1241003	6	6	With highly flexible fingers and precise rhythm control, she excels in music games despite being somewhat clumsy in most other games.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
364	1211003	1	1	Even when Wanshi goes into hibernation, he remains vigilant and alert, like a beast that has to survive in the jungle. He never exposes his weaknesses in unfamiliar environments or in front of strangers. However, rumor has it that he can fall into deep sleep like a child in the presence of the Commandant of Gray Raven.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
365	1211003	2	2	"The frame's new hairstyle seems to draw inspiration from a Kowloong legend about protecting children's health. ""'The immortal touched my head and taught me the secrets of longevity.' They say that's the origin of the Longevity Braid. I don't care much about living long. I'll just live for the lives I've witnessed and carry their wishes as I go."""	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
366	1211003	3	3	Wanshi has always despised lies. In the past, the most he would compromise was keeping silent when he had no other choice. But now, he is willing to try to make a change, to uphold the balance between truth and happiness.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
367	1211003	4	4	"Sometimes, Wanshi can have trouble opening up to others. During a volunteer session at the pediatric department of the Star of Life, a few children patients shared their thoughts about ""Doctor Wanshi"". When a boy described him as ""very nice"", Wanshi simply patted the boy's head without speaking."	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
368	1211003	5	5	"Wanshi's laid-back personality often gives others the impression that he doesn't care about anything. In truth, he has an extraordinary dedication to the people and things he holds dear. ""Have you heard of the torch relays from the Golden Age? They carry a torch and march against the wind. They never give up, even if the flames burn them along the way."""	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
369	1211003	6	6	"Driven by the compassionate nature of a healer, Wanshi vividly remembers every life that crossed his path but eventually faded away. Comrades, patients, strangers - the weight of those lives is quietly carried in his heart, never forgotten. The path he walks no longer belongs to him alone. ""I will lend them my eyes, so they can see this world rise from the ashes."""	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
370	1021006	1	1	Some details of Pyroath's appearance are the mutual work of Lucia and Gray Raven members. The design of the machine spine on the back has accepted Lee's advice. The wings on the sides were painted by Liv. The blonde highlights on the front are of the color that Lucia always wanted to try.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
371	1021006	2	2	The platinum color signifies the longing for the light. A concealing paint was applied on the surface so that the bright color wouldn't expose Lucia in combat, allowing her to become invisible when necessary. The frame is also equipped with four laser drones for better efficiency during stealth combats.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
372	1021006	3	3	Fire would accidentally come out from the seams when Lucia started to get used to the frame, which wouldn't hurt Constructs but would harm humans. Therefore, Lucia practiced alone for a long time until she managed to control the flames with precision.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
373	1021006	4	4	"Lucia depends more on the familiar peripheral devices like Plume's thrusters than unfamiliar components. Therefore, the Science Council has loaded relevant data of ""Feather"" in the maneuvering propellers and Corvus's behavioral model."	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
374	1021006	5	5	Pyroath has a relatively high constant temperature. In cold environments, Lucia would approach the Commandant to provide warmth just in time.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
375	1021006	6	6	Pyroath, the name of the frame, means the fire carrying the oath of guarding everyone during the long night. No matter how long the night would last, Lucia will fight to the end, because this is where her most important dreams and people are.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
376	1311002	1	1	"Fulgor is an Attacker frame especially created to enhance Scarab's adaptability to complex battlefields. When the Science Council asked Yata if she had any suggestions for frame modifications, she responded, ""I don't care. As long as it doesn't hinder my fighting."""	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
377	1311002	2	2	Yata's powered arms were created based on robotic arms. They have gone through material and structure upgrades for better portability and attack ability after Yata changed her frame.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
378	1311002	3	3	With her old life ruined by the disaster caused by Punishing Virus, Yata tends to remain quiet about things related to the Hydrangea Island, refusing to think about her old days on campus.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
379	1311002	4	4	"Yata still exercises even after the Construct surgery. According to herself, ""I feel calm when breathing heavily."" She works out to maintain peak combat readiness at all times. This habit has made Scarab a regular winner of the ""Babylonia Emergency Operation Role Model"" award."	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
380	1311002	5	5	Fulgor's armature can be connected to the powered arms' load backpack to form different shapes with electricity. The baseball bat is Yata's favorite.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
381	1311002	6	6	"Shorthalt once told Yata, ""Bullets are not fired to burn themselves, but they have to get ready for it in order to hit the target."" It wasn't until Shorthalt passed away and Yata became the new captain that she truly understood the meaning of these words—to protect things she cherishes, she has to be the bullet that bravely comes out of the barrel and lights up the sky before the darkness falls."	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
382	1051005	1	1	The foot thrusters, model IR-101, are a supercharged upgrade of Pulse's original thrusters, IR-005. Fed with ecological data from countless planets, they can perfectly adapt to a variety of planetary environments, including Earth.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
383	1051005	2	2	The new frame has significantly improved color sensitivity. Zavier also added a virtual projection board, so Nanami can doodle freely even in a vacuum.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
384	1051005	3	3	The magnetic levitation engine in the back is also designed for outer space. In a vacuum, it will replace the thrusters to generate massive thrust, and it can also work with the thrusters to drive the frame in non-vacuum environments.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
385	1051005	4	4	Influenced by Nanami, Power has gradually developed its own will and embarked on its growth journey. Although it doesn't follow Nanami around like before after the frame upgrade, they still maintain a telepathic connection. When Nanami needs it, Power will join her in battle.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
386	1051005	5	5	"Once she ""transforms,"" she's fully armored with heavy plating, and the Shield Axe she uses is also a heavy weapon. But thanks to the perfect coordination of the thrusters and magnetic levitation engine, the frame moves very lightly and flexibly, not hindered by the weight."	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
387	1051005	6	6	That crosshair in her eye is actually a highly complex photosensor. Once focused, it's like having a mini-telescope built right into her eye. This lets Nanami observe the stars millions of miles away at any time, or look back at Earth's glow while sailing through distant galaxies...	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
388	1321003	1	1	Due to the cognitive limitations of her communication objects, Ishmael rarely reveals her true form. Instead, she tends to appear in the most acceptable form that matches the surroundings and the other object's information processing mode.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
389	1321003	2	2	One of her identities in human civilization is Babylonia Control Court higher-up. Though she's documented as a Construct, there are no obvious Inver-Devices on her frame, and her appearance resembles a real human being. Strangely, nobody has questioned about it ever since she took office.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
390	1321003	3	3	Ishmael rarely focuses on a single moment of time but lays her eyes on the final outcome—why obsess with the details of a fleeting moment if there's no way to change the result?	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
391	1321003	4	4	Ishmael won't interfere with the important nodes of development or deliberately avoid them. She always goes with the mood of the moment. From her perspective, it can lead to more possibilities in the future, and perhaps the answer she's been waiting for is being born quietly at the same time.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
392	1321003	5	5	Today, emotions like love and courage can hardly evoke Ishmael's feelings. She understands them but can no longer get moved due to time and her detached perspective. Sparks of little things die quickly. Even if they converge into flame, they would be inevitably devoured by the cold universe... But fire is fire. It shines as it burns. So she is eager to see how long the flame of mankind can burn and whether it can cut through the endless darkness or not.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
393	1321003	6	6	Remnants of a civilization lie behind the Gateway, like remains sealed in amber in the very moment of death and lasting until today without corruption or continuation. Ishmael would occasionally revisit that place. Perhaps there would be moments when she thinks of an old friend called Gray Raven.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
394	1331003	1	1	A mysterious Ascendant once appeared in the abandoned Las Prados. Most of the information of the Ascendant's frame was lost, but according to the witnesses, its technology and design might have something to do with Babylonia.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
395	1331003	2	2	Considering Lilith's potential needs to attend various social occasions, the designers specially created parts to conceal the mechanical structures during the initial stage of frame design. Meanwhile, it would be helpful for Lilith to get close to the enemy and assassinate them off guard. However, the plan of these parts was canceled later, and Lilith no longer needed such concealment.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
396	1331003	3	3	The frame was originally designed for melee battles and battles in narrow spaces. However, during the adaptation phase, Lilith suggested developing a set of portable card-shaped blades based on cardistry cards to overcome the frame's weakness of lack of firepower in open areas.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
397	1331003	4	4	In addition to cards, Lilith suggested developing many dangerous weapons she called 'magic props' and independently finished the development of some of them.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
398	1331003	5	5	The designers left many hollow structures to hide weapons and for the frame to be able to move faster. However, to solve the power output issue, they eventually decided to greatly enhance the frame's leg strength instead. The hidden pikes can stick out quickly when necessary, making Lilith able to launch a deadly strike at the target.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
399	1331003	6	6	Having passed the strength screening, Lilith has also changed her tactical preference and added more magic techniques to the fight, making it harder for her opponent to predict her movement in battle.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
400	1531005	1	1	"Selena, opera singer, WGAA member, and an experienced soldier. She once went missing in a battle at the space station but then saved by an ""agent"" and started a long journey of retrieving her memories on Earth. At the end of the journey, she found herself again and returned to Babylonia as a new person."	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
401	1531005	2	2	"Pianissimo is a ""new frame"" created based on Capriccio with a series of adjustments. Although the frame was made in a way that is slightly different from that of the specialized frames in the past, this is, for Selena, the plan that suits her habit. Due to the damage she had during her time as Siren, there is still remaining traumatic phantom pain in her M.I.N.D. despite the retrieval of all her memories. Therefore, using Capriccio, the frame that once formed a stable connection to ""Whale Song"" signals, as the basis can relieve the pain."	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
402	1531005	3	3	"Selena is still able to build some kind of special connection to the Punishing Virus. She can ""hear"" the remaining ""sounds"" of the Red Tide and use their power to fight. However, entering this state will cause heavy load to M.I.N.D., so Pianissimo will disconnect from the ""sounds"" and enter the Noise state after a certain period of time. Once healed in the Noise state, the frame will be able to harness the power again."	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
403	1531005	4	4	The powerful computing power of Pianissimo's core enables Selena to play five parts simultaneously even in the fiercest fight. When the suppression device plays a song under the direction of the Bowstring Rapier, it will create overwhelming sound waves that will sweep across the battlefield like a raging storm.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
404	1531005	5	5	"The white floral vine pattern on the frame is a gift from the most important person to Selena. Iris is Selena's favorite flower. In the past, she could only see it in the test tube in the greenhouse. However, during her long journey, she finally got to see them in full blossom on the plain after rain, which, for her, commemorates the fact that the ""truth"" is finally in her hand."	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
405	1531005	6	6	"Selena picked the name ""Pianissimo"" with Gray Raven Commandant. She wants to use it as a reminder to herself that the hall of art does welcomes everyone and that her cello will always sing for everyone she encounters. The name has followed her around in her long battle and served as the pillar that helped her to stand up again and again in the storm."	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
406	1341002	1	1	The frame's prototype was developed by a researcher. After Jetavie passed the awakening trial, the prototype's internal hardware was iterated by the Matrix, while the external armor was modified according to Jetavie's wishes until it became the recognizable Daybreak today.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
407	1341002	2	2	Before she arrived in the real world, Jetavie commanded all the computing power of the Matrix but none of its energy. Although Daybreak's charging unit has an extremely high energy density, it still cannot afford the power needed to utilize Jetavie's immense computing power.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
408	1341002	3	3	Jetavie possesses rich and complex emotions after she is awakened. A lot of real-time processing is required to respond to these signals promptly, so her personality module regularly consumes 60% of her frame's energy.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
409	1341002	4	4	While its combat capability is extraordinary, Jetavie's frame has a comparatively low battery life. During an intense battle, she would briefly disable some of her personality data to keep her combat module running, but the data could be lost if the battle lasted too long.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
410	1341002	5	5	Due to the limitations of the energy structure, the frame's computing power is relatively underpowered. Daybreak's performance is far from what Jetavie is capable of.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
411	1341002	6	6	"The prefix of her designation is ""Matrix-Awakening-Validation"". As the precursor, the Chosen One's designation is 00. Jetavie's designation is 01, and she was also the only individual from Project Matrix who has been validated."	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
412	1131004	1	1	"Geiravor was once one of the experimental frames in Kurono's inventory. However, due to various reasons, it failed to pass the batch testing and could only be recycled after being discarded. During that covert operation on the island, Kurono ""shared"" the data of this frame with Babylonia. Subsequently, Babylonia conducted further modifications and adjustments to the frame, and its performance has now stabilized."	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
413	1131004	2	2	"The frame maintained the design philosophy from the early Reconquista Age, with its Inver-Device preserving a rather exaggerated form. Even after being taken over by Babylonia, the distinctive and decorative structure was kept intact to ""retain aesthetic harmony in its appearance."""	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
414	1131004	3	3	Even in sleep mode, the sentry module installed on the frame stays highly vigilant.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
415	1131004	4	4	"An inconspicuous ""plug""-style device is situated at Geiravor's collarbone position. This functions as a ""valve"" to regulate the frame's release of its maximum combat capabilities. In case of an emergency, removing this restriction allows Geiravor to unleash overwhelming peak superiority."	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
416	1131004	5	5	"Scars from past mission executions mark the back of the frame. Usually hidden by Vera's hair, they go unnoticed by many. Yet, following the frame's transfer to Babylonia, Vera purposefully insisted on retaining these ""scars."" Perhaps it was her way of holding onto something uniquely her own."	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
417	1131004	6	6	The very first Mind Beacon connection between Commandant and Vera was established through this exact frame, despite Commandant's lack of proficiency with the procedure at that time.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
418	1351003	1	1	Older twin brother of Dante. Same to Dante, he is a half-human and half-demon born from the dark knight Sparda and his human wife, Eva.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
419	1351003	2	2	A legendary dark knight that masters rapid laido.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
420	1351003	3	3	Vergil didn't know when or why, but he started to love poetry and philosophy books.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
421	1351003	4	4	Vergil doesn't like heavy weapons, automatic rifles, or any weapons enhanced by human technology.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
422	1351003	5	5	"Vergil has a son named Nero but he didn't know this until Nero grew up. The two's father-son relationship was revealed during some ""final battle."""	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
423	1351003	6	6	"Yamato is one of the weapons left by Vergil's father, Sparda. It is a Devil Sword that only accepts the chosen one as its master. From the weapon's sharp blade, Vergil found the ""absolute power"" he looked for and used it to his advantage."	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
424	1361003	1	1	A half-human and half-demon born from Sparda, the demon hero who saved the human world and his human wife, Eva.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
425	1361003	2	2	The boss of Devil May Cry who also accepts devil hunt missions through specific code phrases as a side job.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
426	1361003	3	3	The most powerful devil hunter alive. Revered for his legendary strength.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
427	1361003	4	4	Dante's signature weapons are the longsword named Rebellion left by his father and the handguns designed by the famous gunsmith Nell Goldstein named Ebony & Ivory, but now he's using the greatsword named Devil Sword Dante.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
428	1361003	5	5	He has overcome multiple difficulties and stopped demons' invasions to the human world.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
429	1361003	6	6	Dante is a tough guy who always keeps his signature smile in difficult situations. He's strong yet gentle with a sense of justice deep down.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
430	1041005	1	1	Although the new frame only underwent hasty adaptation before being deployed in high-intensity combat, the combat side effects are almost negligible thanks to the Science Council's human-centered approach. Even the last minor M.I.N.D. fluctuations were resolved through a Deep M.I.N.D. connection with the Gray Raven Commandant.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
431	1041005	2	2	The frame's surface emits a faint off-white glow, which troubled Bianca for a while as she couldn't find a way to turn it off. It wasn't until she consulted the designer that she learned this was a result of the sunlight absorbed by the crown on her veil.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
432	1041005	3	3	"The designer sheepishly described the frame's glowing feature as ""not particularly useful, but it feels like Bianca."" After some discussions with her, the designer repurposed the solar energy absorbed by the crown into backup power for the frame, which has proved to be unexpectedly effective in harsh combat environments."	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
433	1041005	4	4	"Due to her proficiency with the swordstaff, Bianca initially preferred using her new weapon's sword form. But when the Red Tide cut off her path forward, she instinctively switched the lashblade to its whip form to rescue the trapped commandant from afar. According to Bianca's later recollection, choosing to transform the sword into a whip was ""almost pure instinct."""	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
434	1041005	5	5	"After Asimov ""reversed"" the original Phantom Tracer, he mounted it externally within ""Noctiluca"", Bianca's CUB, significantly reducing the burden on Bianca's M.I.N.D. during the process of compressing the Punishing Virus."	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
435	1041005	6	6	While the coating's white exterior raised questions about its practicality for nighttime operations, the electrochromic fibers it uses actually have excellent adaptive camouflage capabilities, reducing reflectivity to below 0.9% at night.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
436	1371002	1	1	Secator is a new type of Construct created by Babylonia to repair the damaged M.I.N.D. of Discord. Compared to Kurono's old frame which utilized illegal emotional fine-tuning technology, Secator's M.I.N.D. requires more frequent adjustments and stabilization in the early stages, but offers higher adaptability and safety for the pilot.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
437	1371002	2	2	Magnetic field lines and scissors are Discord's beloved weapons. She can skillfully wield them to restrict enemy movement and cut through the battlefield.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
438	1371002	3	3	Power output is boosted to maximum with the mask on. Due to the heavy burden on the M.I.N.D., however, it cannot be used for extended periods.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
439	1371002	4	4	Her experiences have made her more mature than her appearance suggests. Sometimes people find her difficult to approach and talk to because of the mask she often wears.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
440	1371002	5	5	Her reflexes are exceptional—not only on the battlefield, but also in everyday life when she needs to prevent accidents before they happen, such as cutting off Shiva's jinxes before they are spoken.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
441	1371002	6	6	Through everyone's collective efforts, she recovered her past and her M.I.N.D. is repaired. In the future, she hopes to do everything in her power to help others mend their lives.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
442	1381003	1	1	The designers keep testing and upgrading Veronica's frame. In their words, many of its modules are badly worn, and they never expected her to still fight with such power.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
443	1381003	2	2	Veronica no longer resists connecting her M.I.N.D. with the Commandant. At times she even suggests it herself, to make sure her M.I.N.D. does not deviate when traveling alongside the Commandant.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
444	1381003	3	3	She is a mechanoid of immense battle strength, usually proud and solitary. But to the Commandant, her heart is not as cold and tough as her frame. Instead, she has become a reliable companion.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
445	1381003	4	4	When the designers try to create coatings for other occasions, they struggle to adapt the styles to her wings and tail. Later, the Gray Raven Commandant offers an idea, and Veronica accepts it.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
446	1381003	5	5	Veronica is skilled at using her tail in combat, making her tactics more versatile. In some cases, her tail even serves as part of her weaponry. Because of the frame's unique long-tail design, the designers carefully adjust its overall weight balance.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
447	1381003	6	6	She turns the malice and hardships of her past into secrets buried deep in her heart. Though she still often falls silent and struggles to respond to the concern of others, she is slowly learning emotions beyond coldness and bluntness.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
448	1031005	1	1	The new frame's visual module covers a wide range of the visible spectrum. Its pink color is determined by her M.I.N.D.—in other words, Liv can change it to any color she wants. She just hasn't noticed this little design detail yet.	Affection <color=#C14F38>1</color>
449	1031005	2	2	Liv's new weapon, Lotus Wheel, can fly out to a considerable distance and maintain a stable signal link with her, allowing it to often act as her eyes from afar.	Affection <color=#C14F38>2</color>
450	1031005	3	3	Contrary to what the appearance might suggest, the new frame has been adapted for multiple environments and demonstrates outstanding combat performance even underwater.	Affection <color=#C14F38>3</color>
451	1031005	4	4	When she first got this frame, she had all sorts of strange dreams during hibernation. But as long as the Commandant was there, she felt at peace and didn't dream at all.	Affection <color=#C14F38>4</color>
452	1031005	5	5	The frame's skirt reacts to its owner's emotions. When she feels relaxed or happy, it becomes soft and flowing; when she's tense or upset, it hardens and turns sharp.	Affection <color=#C14F38>5</color>
453	1031005	6	6	When she is alone with the Commandant, her tail tends to take on a softer and more relaxed shape. Sometimes she puts her hands behind her back, pretending to be calm, but it's really her way of gathering her fluffed-up skirt to conceal her emotions.	Affection <color=#C14F38>6</color>
