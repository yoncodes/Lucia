1			1	Watanabe	"""The blades that once shielded the people and the legions that fought in Hell have collapsed and fallen beneath the shadow of the Sanctuary. The embers of the past spread with the wind as the """"War Knight"""" gathers the flames and casts the decayed old world into the furnace. When the horns of doomsday are blown, the dead shall rise in search of vengeance, forging their final steel."""	1081004	['Blood DMG', 'Holy DMG']	1011	1011	10113	[1, 2]	1		1015
2			2	Vera	"""The Scorched Borderland knows night no longer as twilight hangs eternal above the Fire Valley. The slumbering Death Knight returns from exile once more, seeking to reclaim her dominion and reforge the passage between the mortal realm and Hell. Yet, the cursed secrets within the ancient scrolls still smolder like a fire that refuses to extinguish. She lives, she blazes, she loves, and she kills—from river to sea, she will witness the destined ending with her own eyes."""	1131004	['Blood DMG', 'Spirit DMG']	1013	1013	10213	[3, 4]	2		1016
3			3	Wanshi	"""The """"Pestilence Knight"""" chases the trail of calamities, seeking the secrets buried beneath them. A shattered childhood, arcane texts of cruelty, and shadowed forests—all entwined by an uncanny dream, converging into the path to redemption. The twisted fate of the Sanctuary looms too near, yet the cure to save the world lies far beyond reach. Upon the long and dusty road, he walks alone."""	1211003	['Spirit DMG', 'Holy DMG']	1010	1010	10013	[5, 7]	3		1017
4			4	Lilith	"""To reclaim the chips stolen by the Sanctuary, she took on the mantle of the Famine Knight, striding through endless wastelands. She refuses to be the loser who slips away from the spotlight, nor the nameless spirit buried in forgotten soil. Having clawed her way back from hell itself, she will roar at the three realms, howl through the blizzard, and make the world remember—""""Gambler Lilith,"""" undefeated and unyielding, has returned to the table."""	1331003	['Holy DMG', 'Spirit DMG']	1012	1012	10313	[6, 8]	4		1012
