It doesn't seem feasible to make them a part of us directly.	[2301]	['How did I come up with such an idea?']	Think carefully about the clues that correspond to each problem.
23000002	23000	2	Why can't we launch a direct attack on the Halo Fortress?	23002	2306	Launching a direct attack is not a good choice. We need an inside-outside attack plan.

32000002	32000	2	Why can't souls enter Hell anymore?	32002	3202	Because the Death Lord's laws of life and death have been severed from the world, disrupting the natural cycle of souls.	That's not the reason why souls cannot enter Hell anymore.	[3204]	['I bet the Tribunal would love to send more souls to Hell.']	It is said that sinful souls fall into Hell during reincarnation and are transformed into demons.

42000003	42000	3	Are these cases connected?	42003	4203	Link the locations on the map, and they seem to form a giant pentagram.	There should be clearer clues to reveal the killer's motive.

43000001	43000	1	Who were these Living Dead when they were alive?	43001	4301	The same emblem painted on their bodies marks their identity and faith.	There must be more direct proof of who they were.
