10201001	10201	Watanabe	Are you ready to hit the road again, Gray Raven?
10201002	10201	Watanabe	Since you've been out for quite a while, both your body and mind need rebuilding. Come get some exercise with me nearby.
10202001	10202	Watanabe	You remember now? You seem to be recovering well.
10202002	10202	Watanabe	We have to locate the Iron Army first if we want to take care of Death of Iron. Investigate with this as the goal.
10203001	10203	Watanabe	Scherman Bastion, Rolling Stone Valley... Yeah, I agree with you.
10203002	10203	Watanabe	There's no time to waste. I'll contact that traveling merchant. Come back to me once you're ready. We have to hurry.
10204001	10204	Watanabe	That was a tough battle. Let's have some rest first.
10204002	10204	Watanabe	Come back anytime you're ready to set off again.
10205001	10205	Watanabe	Under siege by the Sanctuary soldiers, Rusty Yoke is suffering from a growing shortage of supplies. Things are not looking good.
10205002	10205	Watanabe	Let's deal with the threat we have while thinking about how to attack the Halo Fortress.
10206001	10206	Watanabe	Coordinating an inside-outside attack to capture the fortress is bold, but we have no other choice.
10206002	10206	Watanabe	There's gonna be a tough battle. Come back to me when you're ready.
10301001	10301	Death Knight	You're awake. Take a guess at where you're at. Sanctuary or Hell, take your pick.
10301002	10301	Death Knight	If you're ready, let's go. A walk outside might help loosen up your nerves.
10302001	10302	Death Knight	Remember everything now? Time to start the train and return to Hell.
10302002	10302	Death Knight	Come to me when you're ready. Don't keep me waiting for too long.
10303001	10303	Death Knight	It seems the influence of the Sanctuary has made Hell reflect the scenes of the human world. How disgusting.
10303002	10303	Death Knight	Who knows what will happen if we keep dragging this out? Come find me when you have rested up, so we can keep going.
10304001	10304	Death Knight	Let's not waste any time and attack those worthless fools now.
10305001	10305	Death Knight	There seems to be some secret hidden deep within the Acheron River. Stay alert and keep moving forward.
10306001	10306	Death Knight	The darker it gets, the more filthy bastards there are... Stay with me and don't move away.
10306002	10306	Death Knight	Follow my flame and march toward Atlantis.
10307001	10307	Death Knight	Finally got rid of those bastards... How are you? Still able to walk?
10307002	10307	Death Knight	This is the deepest part of the Demon Fortress. Witch Haida might be just ahead. Come to me when you are ready.
10401001	10401	Wanshi	Mm... we're leaving already? Never mind. Day or night, the sky looks the same anyway.
10401002	10401	Wanshi	If you're rested, let's go.
10402001	10402	Wanshi	So you remember. This time it's the reverse of when we first met.
10402002	10402	Wanshi	It's okay if parts are fuzzy. I'll explain on the way to the orphanage.
10403001	10403	Wanshi	Stay alert. We don't know where this horde came from.
10403002	10403	Wanshi	Morigan may be right. We walked straight into the tribespeople's ritual site.
10404001	10404	Wanshi	That same herbal scent from the castle...
10404002	10404	Wanshi	Gray Raven, stick close. There may be more ambushes.
10405001	10405	Wanshi	Let's move. The answers are ahead.
10406001	10406	Wanshi	We've come this far. Whatever truth we find, we face it.
10406002	10406	Wanshi	Thanks for staying with me, Gray Raven.
10501001	10501	Lilith	Still can't remember what happened?
10501002	10501	Lilith	No matter. I've already decided on our next stop: Whitehorse.
10502001	10502	Lilith	Hmm... the angels are acting a little strange.
10502002	10502	Lilith	They're not just picking up the gold that fell from the train. They're looking for something else.
10503001	10503	Lilith	It's been years, and Whitehorse has changed a lot.
10503002	10503	Lilith	Hm? You think I'll get sentimental coming back here? Don't worry. My memories of this place are far from fond.
10504001	10504	Lilith	Bloodsworn, there's one matter I ask you to leave to me: the spoils of war.
10504002	10504	Lilith	I have an old score to settle with the angels, and... I want to savor the taste of victory alone.
10505001	10505	Lilith	Hahahaha, Raphael...
10505002	10505	Lilith	No, it's nothing. Soon she'll regret ever crossing me.
10506001	10506	Lilith	Yes, just like that! Don't stop. Let all power bend to my will!
10507001	10507	Lilith	Bloodsworn... I knew you would return to me.
20001001	20001	Nirvatia	Want to chat with me? Sure, as long as you like. I'll always be here.
20002001	20002	Nirvatia	I will stay at the starting point and quietly await your triumphant return.
20003001	20003	Nirvatia	Come inside and rest for a bit if you are tired. I've prepared your favorite tea and snacks.
