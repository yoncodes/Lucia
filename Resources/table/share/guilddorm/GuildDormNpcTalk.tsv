10101	Commandant, I'm here.	Talk_Idle	1500			['About Summer', 'About the Island', 'Goodbye']	[10102, 10105, 10108]
10102	Summer? I love the warm feeling... But I'll always have this warm feeling as long as I'm with everyone in Gray Raven. What about you, Commandant? Do you feel the same?		1500		10103	['About Summer', 'About the Island', 'Goodbye']	[10102, 10105, 10108]
10103	Feeling hot? Well... I think there are chilled watermelon and cold drinks over there. Liv should also have some things to cool you down. No, I can't do that. You would be frostbitten if I cool you off.		1500		10104	['About Summer', 'About the Island', 'Goodbye']	[10102, 10105, 10108]
10104	Whew... Maybe I can have some ice cream to cool down...		1500			['About Summer', 'About the Island', 'Goodbye']	[10102, 10105, 10108]
10105	There seems to be a grill over there. It's nice to have a barbecue in an outdoor vacation like this, right? But Liv told me to be careful with it... I wonder what she meant...		1500		10106	['About Summer', 'About the Island', 'Goodbye']	[10102, 10105, 10108]
10106	Commandant, not sure if you notice it. The footprints we left when we set foot on this island were washed away by the sea... But the sea will remember them, and so will I.		1500		10107	['About Summer', 'About the Island', 'Goodbye']	[10102, 10105, 10108]
10107	Have you got a plan for our holiday, Commandant?		1500			['About Summer', 'About the Island', 'Goodbye']	[10102, 10105, 10108]
10108	I'll be here for the time being, Commandant.	SummerNpc_Luxiya_Endtalk					
10201	Is there anything I can help with, Commandant?	Talk_Idle	1500			['About the Island', 'About Liv', 'Goodbye']	[10202, 10205, 10208]
10202	I had scanned the entire island before we landed. It's completely safe. The only hidden danger on this island is... that grill over there.		1500		10203	['About the Island', 'About Liv', 'Goodbye']	[10202, 10205, 10208]
10203	You also noticed the stage, Commandant? There are instruments on it. It's said that they were left for the visitors. Would you like to give them a try?		1500		10204	['About the Island', 'About Liv', 'Goodbye']	[10202, 10205, 10208]
10204	This island is warm enough even though it's isolated.		1500			['About the Island', 'About Liv', 'Goodbye']	[10202, 10205, 10208]
10205	Me? If I can, I would like to bring a coconut back and see if I can plant it. Not sure what kind of coconut tree it would grow into in the space... No, of course I won't plant it directly in our lounge.		1500		10206	['About the Island', 'About Liv', 'Goodbye']	[10202, 10205, 10208]
10206	I feel... secure. The wind, the sunshine, and the warm sand will always make me feel relaxed... Do you feel the same, Commandant?		1500		10207	['About the Island', 'About Liv', 'Goodbye']	[10202, 10205, 10208]
10207	I'll remember this holiday we spend together, Commandant.		1500			['About the Island', 'About Liv', 'Goodbye']	[10202, 10205, 10208]
10208	Goodbye, Commandant. I'll always be here.	SummerNpc_Lifu_Endtalk					
10301	Hi, Commandant.	Talk_Idle	1500			['About Summer', 'About the Sea', 'Goodbye']	[10302, 10305, 10308]
10302	In my memory, summer is always full of suffocating dust or a rain that won't stop for dozens of days. It's never this clear and bright. And most importantly, it's comfortable here.		1500		10303	['About Summer', 'About the Sea', 'Goodbye']	[10302, 10305, 10308]
10303	Have you watched the Summer Brawl before? It is an anime from the Golden Age. I think it's a perfect fit for this happy and relaxing time.		1500		10304	['About Summer', 'About the Sea', 'Goodbye']	[10302, 10305, 10308]
10304	I'm already very happy to be able to pass a peaceful summer.		1500			['About Summer', 'About the Sea', 'Goodbye']	[10302, 10305, 10308]
10305	Look! Is that a seagull? I only saw its illustration before, but I can still recognize it just like that. It must be wonderful to fly freely between the sky and the sea... This is, of course, one of my wishes as well.		1500		10306	['About Summer', 'About the Sea', 'Goodbye']	[10302, 10305, 10308]
10306	I actually had a horrible first impression on the sea, but now I finally get the chance to look at it quietly... What's on the other side of the sea?		1500		10307	['About Summer', 'About the Sea', 'Goodbye']	[10302, 10305, 10308]
10307	Go and have a look. What you see is what I want to see.		1500			['About Summer', 'About the Sea', 'Goodbye']	[10302, 10305, 10308]
10308	Goodbye, Commandant.	SummerNpc_Nuoan_Endtalk					
10401	Hmm... What's up, Commandant?	Talk_Idle	1500			['About Summer', 'About the Island', 'Goodbye']	[10402, 10405, 10408]
10402	Spring, summer, fall, and winter are all good seasons to take a sleep... Hmm? You feel the same?		1500		10403	['About Summer', 'About the Island', 'Goodbye']	[10402, 10405, 10408]
10403	Do you like this season? It is a sleepy season... Hmm? No, I don't want to go anywhere else. It's comfortable here. You go for me...		1500		10404	['About Summer', 'About the Island', 'Goodbye']	[10402, 10405, 10408]
10404	At least we have some great sunshine here, right?		1500			['About Summer', 'About the Island', 'Goodbye']	[10402, 10405, 10408]
10405	I checked the coastline, but today is the first time that I get to relax like this... What? We are on holiday? Then let me take a nap first...		1500		10406	['About Summer', 'About the Island', 'Goodbye']	[10402, 10405, 10408]
10406	Speaking of which, the beach chair is perfect to nap on, especially in the sea wind... Do you want to give it a go?		1500		10407	['About Summer', 'About the Island', 'Goodbye']	[10402, 10405, 10408]
10407	Hmm, Kamui has been asking me to play with him in the sea... What? You haven't seen him? Thank God...		1500			['About Summer', 'About the Island', 'Goodbye']	[10402, 10405, 10408]
10408	Good night... No, see you.	SummerNpc_Wanshi_Endtalk					
10501	Hello, Commandant.	Talk_Idle	1500			['About the Sea', 'About Bianca', 'Goodbye']	[10502, 10505, 10508]
10502	In my memory, the sea means more dangerous missions, but faith and purpose are like the rocks. They are unshakable...		1500		10503	['About the Sea', 'About Bianca', 'Goodbye']	[10502, 10505, 10508]
10503	How do you feel about the sea? It won't stay calm like this forever. It can be turbulent and terrifying... But will you still feel the same way you do when it's like that?		1500		10504	['About the Sea', 'About Bianca', 'Goodbye']	[10502, 10505, 10508]
10504	I miss the sea so bad.		1500			['About the Sea', 'About Bianca', 'Goodbye']	[10502, 10505, 10508]
10505	About the frames... Do you mind it? They are part of me, but I prefer to spend my holiday in a more relaxing way.		1500		10506	['About the Sea', 'About Bianca', 'Goodbye']	[10502, 10505, 10508]
10506	For the Purifying Force, the brief moment of standby is our holiday... What about the Task Force? You don't have much time off, do you? Commandant?		1500		10507	['About the Sea', 'About Bianca', 'Goodbye']	[10502, 10505, 10508]
10507	I'll be here watching, Commandant. Both the sea and you.		1500			['About the Sea', 'About Bianca', 'Goodbye']	[10502, 10505, 10508]
10508	See ya, Commandant.	SummerNpc_Bianka_Endtalk					
10601	Hey! Commandant! Nice to see you again!	Talk_Idle	1500			['About Snacks', 'About the Sea', 'Goodbye']	[10602, 10605, 10608]
10602	Commandant! There! Did you see the snack stand over there? Yeah, that thing called hamburger... Oh, it's fast food, right? It smells so good... I wonder how it tastes.		1500		10603	['About Snacks', 'About the Sea', 'Goodbye']	[10602, 10605, 10608]
10603	Kowloong has so many delicious foods in summer! The sweet soup, the bean jelly, the fruits, and the ice bowl. I've heard of the ice bowl, but I never had the chance to try it...		1500		10604	['About Snacks', 'About the Sea', 'Goodbye']	[10602, 10605, 10608]
10604	I've got to take you to try Kowloong's summer snacks if we have the time!		1500			['About Snacks', 'About the Sea', 'Goodbye']	[10602, 10605, 10608]
10605	I remember seeing the sea on the Nighter every day. Or the sea was all that I could see... Sounds confusing, doesn't it? Anyways, I love the sea here!		1500		10606	['About Snacks', 'About the Sea', 'Goodbye']	[10602, 10605, 10608]
10606	By the way, the stars in the night at sea are different from what we see in Babylonia. You haven't seen it before, right? Commandant? Let's look at the stars together at night!		1500		10607	['About Snacks', 'About the Sea', 'Goodbye']	[10602, 10605, 10608]
10607	Commandant, promise you'll take me when you go to the sea.		1500			['About Snacks', 'About the Sea', 'Goodbye']	[10602, 10605, 10608]
10608	Bye, Commandant.	SummerNpc_Pulao_Endtalk					
10701	Ha! There you are.	Talk_Idle	1500			['About the Island', 'About Summer', 'Goodbye']	[10702, 10705, 10708]
10702	My experience tells me that there are a few Corrupted hidden in that beach over there. And I wouldn't be surprised if some Ascendants suddenly come down from the sky... Yeah, that look. You don't need to suppress your nervousness. It's okay. I understand.		1500		10703	['About the Island', 'About Summer', 'Goodbye']	[10702, 10705, 10708]
10703	Commandant, get me a cold drink over there. You can get yourself one too. But don't get the wrong one. For the record, I have no experience in rescuing people who drink the cooling liquid by mistake.		1500		10704	['About the Island', 'About Summer', 'Goodbye']	[10702, 10705, 10708]
10704	The island is perfect for holiday. Plus, it's not boring here.		1500			['About the Island', 'About Summer', 'Goodbye']	[10702, 10705, 10708]
10705	When was the last time when the sea, the summer, and you were together? You should remember, right? Well... You'd better remember.		1500		10706	['About the Island', 'About Summer', 'Goodbye']	[10702, 10705, 10708]
10706	Sometimes I wonder if we should change our clothes, or coatings, according to the season. After all, summer is not a calm season, right?		1500		10707	['About the Island', 'About Summer', 'Goodbye']	[10702, 10705, 10708]
10707	You'll have to make some sacrifice if you want to share this shade with me... Think about it.		1500			['About the Island', 'About Summer', 'Goodbye']	[10702, 10705, 10708]
10708	Hmm? Are you leaving already?	SummerNpc_Weila_Endtalk					
10801	Hello, Conductor.	Talk_Idle	1500			['About the Island', 'About the Stage', 'Goodbye']	[10802, 10805, 10808]
10802	Only the smell of the sea can bring our souls back. I think you can feel it too, right? Conductor? The wind comes from the sea...		1500		10803	['About the Island', 'About the Stage', 'Goodbye']	[10802, 10805, 10808]
10803	Maybe we will only remember the summer we spent together when the horrible storm has passed and the sun casts its light on the ground.		1500		10804	['About the Island', 'About the Stage', 'Goodbye']	[10802, 10805, 10808]
10804	The storm has passed, so we can enjoy the sunshine on the island.		1500			['About the Island', 'About the Stage', 'Goodbye']	[10802, 10805, 10808]
10805	Yes, of course, we've all been on the stage and off the stage. I just miss this feeling. But these instruments... feel so strange.		1500		10806	['About the Island', 'About the Stage', 'Goodbye']	[10802, 10805, 10808]
10806	Would you like to hear something? Maybe I can play something for you. But most of the ball music can't be performed by one person... Would you like to join me, Conductor?		1500		10807	['About the Island', 'About the Stage', 'Goodbye']	[10802, 10805, 10808]
10807	A stage that I can't hide from. A stage that makes me stay.		1500			['About the Island', 'About the Stage', 'Goodbye']	[10802, 10805, 10808]
10808	Until then, Conductor.	SummerNpc_Sailinna_Endtalk					
10901	Hello, Commandant. Is there anything I can help with?	Talk_Idle	1500			['About the Holiday', 'About Chrome', 'Goodbye']	[10902, 10905, 10908]
10902	"Speaking of which, we haven't made time to have some rest for a long time. ""Rest and rejuvenate is also a tactic."" I remember that's what the instructors told us in F.O.S."		1500		10903	['About the Holiday', 'About Chrome', 'Goodbye']	[10902, 10905, 10908]
10903	If the holiday lasts forever, then I'm afraid it will become just like work, right? This is exactly why this holiday is so precious.		1500		10904	['About the Holiday', 'About Chrome', 'Goodbye']	[10902, 10905, 10908]
10904	I'll be around anytime if you want some rest.		1500			['About the Holiday', 'About Chrome', 'Goodbye']	[10902, 10905, 10908]
10905	The unexpected holiday caught me off guard. I don't have any plans yet... What about you, Commandant? Any suggestions?		1500		10906	['About the Holiday', 'About Chrome', 'Goodbye']	[10902, 10905, 10908]
10906	...Oh, sorry, I was lost in thought. I didn't notice that you were calling me. Sometimes I would empty my mind like this when I have the time. It's a good way to relax. You should try, Commandant.		1500		10907	['About the Holiday', 'About Chrome', 'Goodbye']	[10902, 10905, 10908]
10907	Planning holidays for you and yourself is part of your duty as a commandant and captain.		1500			['About the Holiday', 'About Chrome', 'Goodbye']	[10902, 10905, 10908]
10908	Goodbye, Commandant.	SummerNpc_Kuluomu_Endtalk					
11001	What? Are you starting to enjoy the holiday?	Talk_Idle	1500			['About the Island', 'About Lee', 'Goodbye']	[11002, 11005, 11008]
11002	This is a nice place to take a holiday... Would you like to lie down a bit here? Just relax. You're having a holiday.		1500		11003	['About the Island', 'About Lee', 'Goodbye']	[11002, 11005, 11008]
11003	...I'm good, sitting here and enjoying the sea wind. If you want some food, there seem to be some snacks over there, but I'm not sure how it tastes.		1500		11004	['About the Island', 'About Lee', 'Goodbye']	[11002, 11005, 11008]
11004	I'm curious about where the stage gets its power. I bet it's not some mysterious summer power...		1500			['About the Island', 'About Lee', 'Goodbye']	[11002, 11005, 11008]
11005	Me? For me, it's not whether I like it or not. It's just that I feel calm staring at the sea. And it's a good time killer as well.		1500		11006	['About the Island', 'About Lee', 'Goodbye']	[11002, 11005, 11008]
11006	You are so strange. It's your holiday, but you're worrying about other people... I know. I'm fine. I can be better if you want.		1500		11007	['About the Island', 'About Lee', 'Goodbye']	[11002, 11005, 11008]
11007	You can take this holiday as our holiday, because that is what I think.		1500			['About the Island', 'About Lee', 'Goodbye']	[11002, 11005, 11008]
11008	Nothing else? Fine.	SummerNpc_Li_Endtalk					
30001	Oh, you're here.	Stand_Idle	1500			['About Celica', 'Goodbye']	[30002, 30004]
30002	Why am I here, you ask? What if I said it's to oversee the United Command Bureau's work? What's your take?	Stand_Idle	1500	30003			
30003	"—Relax, it may be called ""supervision,"" but it's really just a friendly check-in."	Stand_Happy	1500			['About Celica', 'Goodbye']	[30002, 30004]
30004	I'll be sticking around, so no dodging me, okay?	CommonNpc_Sailika_Endtalk	1500				
30101	Happy New Year, Commandant.	Stand_Happy_Idle	1500			['What are you doing here, Lucia?', 'Care to try some local delicacies?', 'Goodbye']	[30102, 30107, 30110]
30102	Today marks the start of the New Year, a day we're supposed to relax. Liv and I paid a visit to your lounge this morning, but you were already out.	Stand_Idle	1500	30103			
30103	Lee figured you'd either be networking with fellow commandants at the Bureau or honing your skills at the range. Having checked the range, I thought I'd come here to check.	Think_Idle	1500	30104			
30104	Nothing urgent. Tonight, Liv, Lee, and I plan to review Gray Raven's yearly changes. Naturally, you're essential, Commandant.	Stand_Idle	1500	30105			
30105	It's not about discussing tactics. It's a rare chance for Gray Raven folks to chill and chat. Liv and I will prep some snacks ahead of time.	Stand_Idle	1500	30106			
30106	I could've messaged you via the terminal, but inviting you in person seems more... ceremonial? Anyway, look forward to it, Commandant.	Stand_Happy	1500			['What are you doing here, Lucia?', 'Care to try some local delicacies?', 'Goodbye']	[30102, 30107, 30110]
30107	Thanks, Commandant, but no need. I'm just a bit curious about the recipes. Wish I could take some cooking lessons if I get the chance.	No_Happy	1500	30108			
30108	Recently, I realized that more seasoning doesn't necessarily make a dish tastier. But putting that insight into practice is gonna take more work.	Think_Idle	1500	30109			
30109	When I get confident in my cooking, you'll be the first to taste it, Commandant. I promise.	Stand_Happy	1500			['What are you doing here, Lucia?', 'Care to try some local delicacies?', 'Goodbye']	[30102, 30106, 30110]
30110	Alright, Commandant, you carry on.	SpringNpc_Luxiya_Endtalk					
30201	...Happy New Year.	Stand_Idle	1500			['Fancy kite-making?', 'A rare break...', 'Goodbye']	[30202, 30206, 30210]
30202	I tried kite-making as a kid. Although I managed to create one, Murray wasn't free to play outside like other kids.	Think_Close	1500	30203			
30203	Seeing all these materials and samples here kinda makes me nostalgic.	Think_Close	1500	30204			
30204	...You're thinking of giving it a shot? I'm game, but the weather Babylonia has been snowy lately. Not exactly ideal for kite-flying.	Think_Idle	1500	30205			
30205	Good point. There's no rush. And it's not like we'll nail it on our first try. But I'll stick with you until we get it just right.	Stand_Idle	1500			['Fancy kite-making?', 'A rare break...', 'Goodbye']	[30202, 30206, 30210]
30206	Yes, it's my day off, so I'm just wandering about. Don't get it twisted, I didn't come here just to find you.	Stand_Idle	1500	30207			
30207	Chatted with Murray this morning. On my way back to the lounge, I thought of someone who's all work and no play, so I decided to swing by.	Stand_Idle	1500	30208			
30208	Knew I'd find you here. I mean, you remind everyone else to take a break today, but here you are.	Think_Close	1500	30209			
30209	...Just out for a walk...? Let's assume you're being honest.	Think_Idle	1500			['Fancy kite-making?', 'A rare break...', 'Goodbye']	[30202, 30206, 30210]
30210	Yeah.	SpringNpc_Li_Endtalk					
30301	Seen the first snow of the new year yet, Commandant?	Talk_Happy	1500			"['Happy New Year, Liv.', ""How's your fortune today, Liv?"", 'Goodbye']"	[30302, 30307, 30310]
30302	Happy New Year, Commandant. Oh, I should've been the one to say it first...	Stand_Happy_Idle	1500	30303			
30303	Commandant, you can't be frowning right from the start of the year. Even at the squad's late-night get-togethers recently...	No_Happy	1500	30304			
30304	I'm aware you're juggling a lot, Commandant. But remember what Lucia said? As long as we stick together, there's nothing we can't overcome.	Stand_Idle	1500	30305			
30305	If things get too much to handle, feel free to lean on me more. I'm set on being more reliable this year.	Stand_Idle	1500	30306			
30306	That's the smile we're all hoping to see. Keeping you at ease is everyone's unspoken hope.	Stand_Happy	1500			"['Happy New Year, Liv.', ""How's your fortune today, Liv?"", 'Goodbye']"	[30302, 30307, 30310]
30307	Oops, hit a button on the device by mistake. Did you catch that, Commandant? Silly me...	Think_Cry	1500	30308			
30308	"The oracle says, ""Fluky"". Advisable for a big cleanup, inadvisable for... wanting it all. Guess it's true, greed gets you nowhere."	Stand_Idle	1500	30309			
30309	So today, from now on, I will just focus on what's in front of me—the snowscape and everyone around.	Stand_Happy	1500			"['Happy New Year, Liv.', ""How's your fortune today, Liv?"", 'Goodbye']"	[30302, 30307, 30310]
30310	Alright, Commandant, see you later.	SpringNpc_Lifu_Endtalk					
30401	...Why do you look so surprised?	Stand_Idle	1500			['What are you doing here?!', 'I never pegged you as someone into bamboo gazing.', 'Goodbye']	[30402, 30407, 30410]
30402	Isn't New Year's the perfect time for connecting with loved ones in your book?	Think_Idle	1500	30403			
30403	Or did I get you all wrong, and you're not expecting any of this at all?	Stand_Idle	1500	30404			
30404	There's nothing to be nervous about. I've got my power under control for now. No plans to sink this human ark today.	Stand_Idle	1500	30405			
30405	...A scarf? Had nothing ready, so this is your New Year's gift? I didn't come to ask for anything, you know.	Think_Idle	1500	30406			
30406	But... even if you have your choices and I have mine, I still cherish the freedom to occasionally defy fate.	Stand_Idle	1500			['What are you doing here?!', 'I never pegged you as someone into bamboo gazing.', 'Goodbye']	[30402, 30407, 30410]
30407	"No. It's just that everything here has this ""enhanced"" feel to it. The plants, the weather... they're different from what you'd find on the surface."	Think_Idle	1500	30408			
30408	Try to remember how they feel. Next time, maybe during a snowfall, if I come across a bamboo grove, I'll bring you along.	Stand_Idle	1500	30409			
30409	"Then you'll see what I mean by ""different."""	Stand_Idle	1500			['What are you doing here?!', 'I never pegged you as someone into bamboo gazing.', 'Goodbye']	[30402, 30407, 30410]
30410	You head off. When I need to find you, I know how to track you down.	SpringNpc_LuxiyaR3_Endtalk					
30501	Good day, Commandant—and a Happy New Year to you.	Talk_Happy	1500			['Interested in fireworks?', 'Keeping busy during these holidays?', 'Goodbye']	[30502, 30506, 30509]
30502	Karenina used to have me test some of her explosive inventions. One was pretty much like fireworks.	Think_Idle	1500	30503			
30503	It's not ground-fired, though. Karenina launches them, then I trigger them with my arrows.	Stand_Idle	1500	30504			
30504	In order to observe the range, Karenina added bright-colored powder. Although it's for weapon testing, I can't deny that the blasts are as beautiful as fireworks.	Stand_Happy	1500	30505			
30505	If you're interested, Commandant, I can recreate that colorful blaze with my arrows, festival or not. Of course, I'll ask Karenina to limit the powder amount to serve purely for the purpose of spectacle.	Stand_Idle	1500			['Interested in fireworks?', 'Keeping busy during these holidays?', 'Goodbye']	[30502, 30506, 30509]
30506	As the captain of the Purifying Force, I need to be on standby for duty. But there haven't been any assignments lately, so it's kinda like downtime.	Think_Idle	1500	30507			
30507	But in my spare time, I do some praying. After all, it's a time of renewal, right?	Stand_Idle	1500	30508			
30508	Plus, with Babylonia scheduled for snowfall these days, the snowy scenery itself brings back memories worth a prayer or two.	Stand_Happy	1500			['Interested in fireworks?', 'Keeping busy during these holidays?', 'Goodbye']	[30502, 30506, 30509]
30509	See you, Commandant.	SpringNpc_Bianka_Endtalk	1500				
30601	Ah, Commandant! Happy New Year!	Greet_Happy	1500			"[""What's Pulao scribbling over there?"", 'Are you not taking the day off?', 'Goodbye']"	[30602, 30606, 30610]
30602	Oh, this? I was just... sketching something for fun!	Shy_Idle	1500	30603			
30603	It's definitely not because it's too messy to show!	Refuse_Concentrate	1500	30604			
30604	Ugh, you saw... Actually, I found some ink and thought I'd show off my calligraphy...	Think_Cry	1500	30605			
30605	Who knew Calligraphy was as tough as math... I've gotta practice more when I get back. If it goes well, maybe I'll gift you a handwritten spring couplet next year!	Think_Cry	1500			"[""What's Pulao scribbling over there?"", 'Are you not taking the day off?', 'Goodbye']"	[30602, 30606, 30610]
30606	Taking the day off? Absolutely! Kowloong is buzzing during these special festival days. The streets are brimming with delicious treats and fun activities!	Victory_Happy2	1500	30607			
30607	Me? I've got to be responsible during working hours! Besides, the overtime pay during the festival...	Think_Drool	1500	30608			
30608	Ahem, in any case, I need to focus on my work so everyone in Kowloong can enjoy the holiday. I won't lose sight of that!	Stand_Idle	1500	30609			
30609	Hey, the festivities in Kowloong aren't over yet. If you've got some time, Commandant, how about joining me for a trip there?	Stand_Happy	1500			"[""What's Pulao scribbling over there?"", 'Are you not taking the day off?', 'Goodbye']"	[30602, 30606, 30610]
30610	You carry on, Commandant.	SpringNpc_Pulao_Endtalk					
30701	Oh?	Stand_Idle	1500			['Craving some tanghulu?', 'Happy New Year!', 'Goodbye']	[30702, 30706, 30709]
30702	I just figured it'd be a local delicacy worth bringing along when I report back to Jamilah.	Think_Close	1500	30703			
30703	Depending on the train's region and season, local festive items like these really catch on.	Stand_Idle	1500	30704			
30704	Let me have a taste before deciding? Fair point.	Stand_Idle	1500	30705			
30705	...Hmm, so sweet.	Stand_Happy_Idle	1500			['Craving some tanghulu?', 'Happy New Year!', 'Goodbye']	[30702, 30706, 30709]
30706	...Happy New Year. What's the proper etiquette for this moment, according to Kowloong tradition?	Stand_Idle	1500	30707			
30707	Just enjoy the vibe, you say? Got it.	Think_Idle	1500	30708			
30708	Next time you visit the Akdilek Commercial Alliance, I'll treat you to a special vibe. Consider it a return gift, no, an invitation.	Stand_Idle	1500			['Craving some tanghulu?', 'Happy New Year!', 'Goodbye']	[30702, 30706, 30709]
30709	That's about it.	SpringNpc_Sufeiya_Endtalk					
40101	I finally meet you again, Commandant.	Stand_Happy_Idle	1500			['About Sky Island', 'About Gray Raven', 'Goodbye']	[40102, 40105, 40108]
40102	The security around here is not guaranteed, but this place has good lighting and offers a nice view. The fountain over there...	Think_Idle	1500	40103			
40103	Commandant, do you want to toss a coin into the fountain and make a wish there? I think I've heard about a tradition like that... What kind of wish do you want to make?	Stand_Idle	1500	40104			
40104	I wish I could learn to cook delicious food for everyone... Commandant, why are you giving me that look?	Stand_Happy_Cry	1500			['About Sky Island', 'About Gray Raven', 'Goodbye']	[40102, 40105, 40108]
40105	Even during my downtime, I still always think about everyone in Gray Raven first and what we can do together.	Stand_Happy	1500	40106			
40106	We've become like a family now, after all. Sometimes, I worry that it might be a burden for others, though.	Think_Idle	1500	40107			
40107	With that being said, I still want to ask for your help in considering it. But before we dive into that, shall we head to the restaurant first?	Stand_Happy	1500			['About Sky Island', 'About Gray Raven', 'Goodbye']	[40102, 40105, 40108]
40108	I'm always here, Commandant.	SkyNpc_Common_PatrolEndtalk					
40201	Commandant, what's next?	Stand_Happy	1500			['About Sky Island', 'About Summer', 'Goodbye']	[40202, 40205, 40208]
40202	From here, you can have a clear view of the sea below... and even every subtle wave on the sea surface.	Think_Idle	1500	40203			
40203	It's like it has become part of the sky, a completely different view from what we've seen in Babylonia... Do you feel the same, Commandant?	Think_Close	1500	40204			
40204	I imagine myself becoming the sky, the sea, or as free as the wind... Ah, I guess in the end, I still want to be with you and everyone else.	Think_Close_StandHappy	1500			['About Sky Island', 'About Summer', 'Goodbye']	[40202, 40205, 40208]
40205	I don't have many childhood memories of summer, but the first thing that comes to mind is seeing a mama sheep and her lamb on a distant hillside during a family trip.	Think_Close	1500	40206			
40206	Later on, the change of seasons became a blur, and people didn't really have time to pay attention to the scenery around them.	Stand_Idle	1500	40207			
40207	Let's create more memories of summer together, Commandant.	Stand_Happy	1500			['About Sky Island', 'About Summer', 'Goodbye']	[40202, 40205, 40208]
40208	Let me know if there's anything I can help you with, Commandant!	SkyNpc_Common_Endtalk					
40301	Do you have any plan for your vacation, Commandant?	Stand_Idle	1500			['About Sky Island', 'About Summer', 'Goodbye']	[40302, 40305, 40308]
40302	In order to ensure a safe flight, many parameters must be carefully adjusted.	Think_Idle	1500	40303			
40303	Moreover, the island must be designed to adapt to various weather conditions, and the routes must be strategically planned to minimize the impact of extreme weather...	Think_Idle	1500	40304			
40304	There are people in charge of this? I know, but when it comes to your safety, I can only rest assured if I go through the maintenance process myself.	Stand_Idle	1500			['About Sky Island', 'About Summer', 'Goodbye']	[40302, 40305, 40308]
40305	Feelings about summer? Nothing particularly noteworthy. After all this time fighting on the surface, I don't really feel the change of seasons.	Stand_Idle	1500	40306			
40306	But both Lucia and Liv seem excited about it. After all, summer is often associated with... precious memories.	Think_Close	1500	40307			
40307	So, if you've got some free time, want to do something together?	Stand_Idle	1500			['About Sky Island', 'About Summer', 'Goodbye']	[40302, 40305, 40308]
40308	The weather forecast shows it will be sunny. Enjoy the rest of your vacation, Commandant.	SkyNpc_Common_PatrolEndtalk					
40401	Want to relax for some time, Commandant?	Stand_Idle	1500			['About Sky Island', 'About Summer', 'Goodbye']	[40402, 40405, 40408]
40402	If you're looking for some good spots where you won't be bothered, I've got some advice for you.	Talk_Idle	1500	40403			
40403	You know, for a sniper like me, finding the most hidden spot in any area... is a walk in the park.	Stand_Idle	1500	40404			
40404	No need, huh? Well, I can also tell you about the best place to hang out, the best place to eat, and the best place to read. Trust me, they've all got stellar reviews.	Think_Idle_StandIdle	1500			['About Sky Island', 'About Summer', 'Goodbye']	[40402, 40405, 40408]
40405	Things I want to do in summer? Um... you probably already have the answer in your mind before even asking me, don't you?	Think_Idle	1500	40406			
40406	But... I just had a good rest and I'm totally ready to do something else.	Stand_Idle	1500	40407			
40407	I found the best place to overlook the entire island, and I'm going to check it out... Want to come with me? Things might feel completely different from a different viewpoint.	Talk_Idle	1500			['About Sky Island', 'About Summer', 'Goodbye']	[40402, 40405, 40408]
40408	Good morning, Commandant...	SkyNpc_Common_Endtalk					
40501	What's up?	Stand_Idle	1500			['About Sky Island', 'About Summer', 'Goodbye']	[40502, 40505, 40508]
40502	Creating a stable island in the sky might not be too challenging, but getting the right balance between beauty and practicality can definitely be tough!	Show_Serious	1500	40503			
40503	In the resting areas, special silencing devices have to be used to dampen the noise from the flight engines... There are also gravitational forces and safety facilities to be considered...	Talk_Serious	1500	40504			
40504	—Commandant Dumbass, are you even listening? This level of intricate design can only be done by my Engineering Force! So, how about giving me a well-deserved compliment?	Refuse_Idle	1500			['About Sky Island', 'About Summer', 'Goodbye']	[40502, 40505, 40508]
40505	Every time summer arrives, I have to adjust my frame's cooling system. It's the most annoying part!	Refuse_Idle	1500	40506			
40506	Especially during summer, the building materials will all get scorching hot, not good at all for construction.	Stand_Idle	1500	40507			
40507	But since you're on vacation, fine... I'll adjust the cooling power and join you for a walk—purely because I want to see the seagulls. Who says I'm going to wear a dress?!	Show_Idle	1500			['About Sky Island', 'About Summer', 'Goodbye']	[40502, 40505, 40508]
40508	Oh, you're leaving already...? Just so you know, I'll be quite busy myself later!	SkyNpc_Common_Endtalk					
40601	Are you going to take Nanami out? Let's go!	Greet_Happy	1500			['About Sky Island', 'About Summer', 'Goodbye']	[40602, 40605, 40608]
40602	It looks like so much fun here! Over there too! But where's the control room? Nanami wants to speed up more!	Jump_Happy	1500	40603			
40603	Adding a cannon would be great! Can we get Power one of them? Can we?	Jump_Happy	1500	40604			
40604	Reeeally... It's a pity that we can't have Power modified, but Nanami will still get the job done! Onto the next mission: Sneak into the control room!	Think_Jump_Idle	1500			['About Sky Island', 'About Summer', 'Goodbye']	[40602, 40605, 40608]
40605	Nanami likes summer because there's so much fun, but actually, Nanami thinks everything is fun.	Jump_Happy	1500	40606			
40606	Moreover, Nanami is the strongest in summer! Because Nanami is the strongest whenever! Huh? Oh, so you just like summer itself.	Show_Serious	1500	40607			
40607	Alrighty! I'm going to challenge the sun next! Power ready! Let's go! I'm just kidding. I think I'll have more fun hanging out with Commandant.	Jump_Happy	1500			['About Sky Island', 'About Summer', 'Goodbye']	[40602, 40605, 40608]
40608	No more playing? Nanami will always be here!	SkyNpc_Common_PatrolEndtalk					
40701	Shh... Don't tell anyone I'm here. I don't want to be recognized...	Think_Scared	1500			['About Sky Island', 'About Summer', 'Goodbye']	[40702, 40705, 40708]
40702	No one would expect... to see me here, right...? It's okay. I won't let people see through my disguise...	Think_Idle	1500	40703			
40703	But... let's just talk here... You'll fall if you get too close to the edge... It's better to stay in a safe spot.	Think_Idle	1500	40704			
40704	Now that I think about it, coming all the way here and then having to figure out how to get back is a bit of a hassle... How about you give me a ride back? Then, I won't have to worry about hiding.	Think_Happy	1500			['About Sky Island', 'About Summer', 'Goodbye']	[40702, 40705, 40708]
40705	When it comes to summer, many would want to go swimming... I never had the chance to learn it before becoming like this...	Think_Idle	1500	40706			
40706	I don't need to learn it anymore. I can hide underwater whenever I want now... and no one will ever notice...	Think_Idle	1500	40707			
40707	What I'm trying to say must be different from what you think about swimming... Hm? Oh, I never really talk to fish.	Think_Cry	1500			['About Sky Island', 'About Summer', 'Goodbye']	[40702, 40705, 40708]
40708	Want to run away...	SkyNpc_Common_Endtalk					
40801	Hello, Commandant.	Stand_Idle	1500			['About Sky Island', 'About Summer', 'Goodbye']	[40802, 40805, 40808]
40802	This place has a lot of business potential... From my personal perspective, it appears feasible to run Akdilek stores here.	Stand_Happy_Idle	1500	40803			
40803	...Are you asking about my own feelings? I like this place. It's close to the sky, and the sky... feels free, different from the universe, and it's quiet here.	Stand_Idle	1500	40804			
40804	If we're talking about being with you, I also feel safe... Commandant, that area seems to be an ideal location for a deli.	Stand_Idle	1500			['About Sky Island', 'About Summer', 'Goodbye']	[40802, 40805, 40808]
40805	I have hazy memories of summer. The train was always... unbearably hot, and people would often suffer from heatstroke. If it became too scorching, it would significantly impede the progress of work.	Think_Close	1500	40806			
40806	I really enjoy having ice cream. If we place the ice cream machine here, we can have some together.	Stand_Idle	1500	40807			
40807	Does this count as my attempt to learn how to take care of others...? If you come to buy ice cream, I'll offer it to you at a cost price.	Think_Idle	1500			['About Sky Island', 'About Summer', 'Goodbye']	[40802, 40805, 40808]
40808	Commandant, until next time.	SkyNpc_Common_PatrolEndtalk					
40901	Is there anything I can help you with, Commandant?	Stand_Idle	1500			['About Summer', 'About Rosetta', 'Goodbye']	[40902, 40905, 40908]
40902	Summer in the Arctic region is not as cold as people would imagine. Have you ever walked on a tundra, Commandant?	Talk_Idle	1500	40903			
40903	There are a lot of creatures out there. Commandant, have you ever come across Arctic foxes? I once saw a pack of them while they were hunting... They looked adorable running around. Some of the braver ones would even bark in the direction of the Forest Guards.	Think_Idle	1500	40904			
40904	Whether it's on land, in the sky, or out at sea, everyone is giving their all in their own lives. When you have the time, let's visit my hometown together, Commandant.	Stand_Idle	1500			['About Summer', 'About Rosetta', 'Goodbye']	[40902, 40905, 40908]
40905	Continue to stay in mid-air in a floating place...? It feels kind of strange. The island also looks a bit lonely in the air...	Think_Idle	1500	40906			
40906	But I already got used to this kind of life. Going through hardships can make one more open-minded about life.	Stand_Idle	1500	40907			
40907	My apologies! I didn't mean to burden you with my ramblings... Commandant, what would you like to do next? Want me to give you a quick ride? It's pretty nice to fly through the sky.	Stand_Happy_Idle	1500			['About Summer', 'About Rosetta', 'Goodbye']	[40902, 40905, 40908]
40908	See you, Commandant.	SkyNpc_Common_Endtalk					
41001	Hm? Oh, it's you, Commandant. I'm patrolling my territory.	Jump_Idle	1500			['About Sky Island', 'About Summer', 'Goodbye']	[41002, 41005, 41008]
41002	The ground is so far away... I'm not afraid of falling, but it's not safe for you to stay here.	Think_Idle	1500	41003			
41003	Where's Noctis? If it's him, I can kick his ass however I want. It would be even better if I could throw him down from here.	Show_Idle	1500	41004			
41004	I guess this counts as part of my territory patrol. I've got it all understood, Commandant.	Stand_Idle	1500			['About Sky Island', 'About Summer', 'Goodbye']	[41002, 41005, 41008]
41005	Summer means going out and having fun... but I don't know who to be with besides Vera and Noctis. Hm... I can play by myself too.	Think_Idle	1500	41006			
41006	"Hm? You want to play with me, Commandant? But I don't know any games for two people. The only two-player game I'm good at is ""kicking ass."""	Stand_Idle	1500	41007			
41007	But I don't want to kick Commandant's ass. Commandant is a good person. A good person can share snacks with me.	Talk_Idle	1500			['About Sky Island', 'About Summer', 'Goodbye']	[41002, 41005, 41008]
41008	Time to say goodbye? Goodbye, Commandant.	SkyNpc_Common_PatrolEndtalk					
50101	"Happy New Year! Are you also here with a ""mission""?"	Talk_Idle	800			['About New Year Purchases', 'About Friends', 'Goodbye']	[50102, 50105, 50108]

50103	"But what exactly classifies as ""New Year Purchases""? Food? Daily products? Is this lamp one of the New Year goods? It looks very delicate. Could it be expensive...?"		800		50104	['About New Year Purchases', 'Goodbye']	[50102, 50108]
50104	Oh... Are you getting it for me? Thanks.		800			['About Friends', 'Goodbye']	[50105, 50108]

50106	Food should do the trick, right? I just realize this stall sells sweet cakes, but that stall sells spicy ones. How weird.		800		50107	['About Friends', 'Goodbye']	[50105, 50108]
50107	Guess I'll just buy a little bit of everything. What flavor do you prefer? I can get one for you too.		800			['About New Year Purchases', 'Goodbye']	[50102, 50108]
50108	Let's check that stall over there. What are they selling?	2024SpringNpc_Sufeiya_Endtalk					
50201	Oh, hello. Happy New Year and wish you a great fortune!	Talk_Idle	800			['About Shopping', 'About Eternal Engine', 'Goodbye']	[50202, 50205, 50208]
50202	Shopping takes more skill than you would think. First, you need sharp eyes to pick out the best goods. Then, you also need to know how to haggle... Look, there's a stall ahead. Let me show you how it's done.		800		50203	['About Shopping', 'Goodbye']	[50202, 50208]
50203	Got it? This is how you bargain: slash the price in half, then work your way up bit by bit.		800		50204	['About Shopping', 'Goodbye']	[50202, 50208]
50204	You've never seen such a low price, have you? You should try bargaining next time. It saves quite a bit!		800			['About Eternal Engine', 'Goodbye']	[50205, 50208]
50205	The crew members on the Eternal Engine want to celebrate the festival too. Come along!		800		50206	['About Eternal Engine', 'Goodbye']	[50205, 50208]
50206	As the old saying goes, it's a fresh new start after the Spring Festival. A new year always brings new hopes, so this year is bound to be better, right?		800		50207	['About Eternal Engine', 'Goodbye']	[50205, 50208]
50207	In the upcoming year, I'm sure we'll be able to establish more trade zones, connecting more people and regions together... Just thinking about it already makes me so excited!		800			['About Shopping', 'Goodbye']	[50202, 50208]
50208	Oh, you're leaving already? Goodbye! Don't forget the bargaining tips I taught you!	2024SpringNpc_Changyu_Endtalk

50303	Whatever the case is, please follow the safety guidelines and set off firecrackers in the correct way. Also, stay alert for any unusual creatures...		800		50304	['About Holiday', 'Goodbye']	[50302, 50308]
50304	Whew, I think that covers all the safety rules. Please stay safe during the holidays, Commandant.		800			['About Gifts', 'Goodbye']	[50305, 50308]
50305	"I bought these gifts from a stall over there. Even if I told myself that I was ""just browsing,"" after walking around, I couldn't help but think this would be perfect for Commandant, and that one would suit my sister... Before I realized it, I had already bought a lot."		800		50306	['About Gifts', 'Goodbye']	[50305, 50308]
50306	Sister is helping me carry some of the stuff. She's right behind...		800		50307	['About Gifts', 'Goodbye']	[50305, 50308]
50307	Sorry, sister! I bought too much!		800			['About Holiday', 'Goodbye']	[50302, 50308]
50308	Commandant, let's explore that area together when you have a break.	2024SpringNpc_Yalisha_Endtalk					
50401	Why are you getting so close... do you have something for me?	Talk_Idle	800			['About Sweet Dumplings', 'About Snowflakes', 'Goodbye']	[50402, 50405, 50408]
50402	What are they? Sweet dumplings? Fine, I'll try one...		800		50403	['About Sweet Dumplings', 'Goodbye']	[50402, 50408]
50403	Ouch, it's too hot! Get me that chilled electrolyte over there!		800		50404	['About Sweet Dumplings', 'Goodbye']	[50402, 50408]
50404	...It actually tastes not bad after I let it cool. The wrapper is soft and sticky; the fillings look normal but have a unique taste... Interesting.		800			['About Snowflakes', 'Goodbye']	[50405, 50408]
50405	You don't need to block them. I'm not cold. The snowflakes fall from the sky... they are clean.		800		50406	['About Snowflakes', 'Goodbye']	[50405, 50408]
50406	It's a pity that they melt when they land on the table. Maybe I can make it colder to keep them longer...		800		50407	['About Snowflakes', 'Goodbye']	[50405, 50408]
50407	Well, I probably should not. I'm afraid you won't be able to sustain that cold.		800			['About Sweet Dumplings', 'Goodbye']	[50402, 50408]
50408	You can go first. I want to stay a little longer.	2024SpringNpc_Luna_Endtalk					
50501	What are you doing here?	Talk_Idle	800			['About Tea', 'About Wishes', 'Goodbye']	[50502, 50505, 50508]
50502	Is this the tea you bought to celebrate New Year? Why is the lid sealed so tightly? One sec... Alright, it's open now.		800		50503	['About Tea', 'Goodbye']	[50502, 50508]
50503	The Kowloong way of preparing tea can be intricate. I'm not good at it, but I wouldn't mind having tea in a simpler way here.		800		50504	['About Tea', 'Goodbye']	[50502, 50508]
50504	...Not bad.		800			['About Wishes', 'Goodbye']	[50505, 50508]
50505	New Year's wishes? I never make them. Wanting too many things is like holding sand—it will just slip through your fingers.		800		50506	['About Wishes', 'Goodbye']	[50505, 50508]
50506	There are some things I'll never give up. As for the others, I won't go out of my way to chase them.		800		50507	['About Wishes', 'Goodbye']	[50505, 50508]
50507	But if it's your wish... Maybe I'll help you make it come true if you tell me.		800			['About Tea', 'Goodbye']	[50502, 50508]
50508	We will meet again.	2024SpringNpc_Luxiya_Endtalk					
50601	What a coincidence. Fate has brought us together.	Talk_Idle	800			['About the Display', 'About Reunion', 'Goodbye']	[50602, 50605, 50608]
50602	I like the way this stall is set up. I heard there's a... festival gala tonight? Do you need me to perform onstage?		800		50603	['About the Display', 'Goodbye']	[50602, 50608]
50603	I have actually prepared a stage play.		800		50604	['About the Display', 'Goodbye']	[50602, 50608]
50604	Of course, if you'd like, I can also give you a private performance. What do you think?		800			['About Reunion', 'Goodbye']	[50605, 50608]
50605	Family reunions? Very festive, but not for me. How about something more interesting?		800		50606	['About Reunion', 'Goodbye']	[50605, 50608]
50606	For example, I could whisk you away and run to a place where no other Constructs can find us. That would be fun, don't you think?		800		50607	['About Reunion', 'Goodbye']	[50605, 50608]
50607	Maybe I can perform the play I prepared? It's a dull, cliched, and meaningless comedy. Still want to see it? Hah, your choice never fails to surprise me...		800			['About the Display', 'Goodbye']	[50602, 50608]
50608	Oh, what a brief encounter...	2024SpringNpc_Luolan_Endtalk					
50701	I hope no one can find me.	Talk_Idle	800			['About Companion', 'About Eating Fish', 'Goodbye']	[50702, 50705, 50708]
50702	What are you doing? You've been all over the place. What, was I sneaking up on you? No... no way! I was just... enjoying the view! Right, the view.		800		50703	['About Companion', 'Goodbye']	[50702, 50708]
50703	Why are you here alone though?		800		50704	['About Companion', 'Goodbye']	[50702, 50708]
50704	I don't mind spending the time with you... if you don't have an appointment with anyone else.		800			['About Eating Fish', 'Goodbye']	[50705, 50708]
50705	"""Abundance of Fish""... Eek, just looking at this dish's name already makes my tail hurt..."		800		50706	['About Eating Fish', 'Goodbye']	[50705, 50708]
50706	That being said, these fish are so tiny. If you really want to eat fish, I can catch some big ones for you...		800		50707	['About Eating Fish', 'Goodbye']	[50705, 50708]
50707	You'll owe me a favor then... Never mind. Just remember to thank me later.		800			['About Companion', 'Goodbye']	[50702, 50708]
50708	Are you leaving again...? Oh, you'll be back? Then I'll wait for you here.	2024SpringNpc_Lamiya_Endtalk					
50801	Commandant, we have stepped into another new year together.	Talk_Idle	800			['About Time', 'About Gifts', 'Goodbye']	[50802, 50805, 50808]
50802	I often hear people say that time is a continuously flowing river, so nothing will change no matter how we celebrate the New Year.		800		50803	['About Time', 'Goodbye']	[50802, 50808]
50803	But right now, with you and Gray Raven around, this day is more than just a festival—it is an anniversary of our time together.		800		50804	['About Time', 'Goodbye']	[50802, 50808]
50804	Gray Raven had been through a lot this year, but nothing could stop us—stop me from reaching you.		800			['About Gifts', 'Goodbye']	[50805, 50808]
50805	Commandant, it's time to open gifts. The weather's still quite cold lately, so I picked a scarf for you.		800		50806	['About Gifts', 'Goodbye']	[50805, 50808]
50806	I spent a long time in the store debating on the color. In the end, I chose red, because it was the warmest color.		800		50807	['About Gifts', 'Goodbye']	[50805, 50808]
50807	As for the froggie on top... Sorry, it was my work...		800			['About Time', 'About Gifts']	[50802, 50808]
50808	I got a box of fireworks. Shall we head to the square right now?	2024SpringNpc_LuxiyaB_Endtalk					
50901	Commandant, over here.	Talk_Idle	800			['About Entertainment', 'About Tea', 'Goodbye']	[50902, 50906, 50909]
50902	It's your turn, Commandant.		800		50903	['About Entertainment', 'Goodbye']	[50902, 50909]
50903	I bet you still have a few smaller cards in your hand. Are you sure you want to play a card this big now?		800		50904	['About Entertainment', 'Goodbye']	[50902, 50909]
50904	I lost... No, I didn't go easy on you. I just didn't expect that you'd play your cards in that way.		800		50905	['About Entertainment', 'Goodbye']	[50902, 50909]
50905	Wait, there's punishment? So I need to stick these papers to my forehead? Um...		800			['About Tea', 'Goodbye']	[50906, 50909]
50906	One moment, Commandant. For the second time, the water needs to be boiled for fifteen seconds... Three, two, one. Alright, pass me your cup now.		800		50907	['About Tea', 'Goodbye']	[50906, 50909]
50907	I've been studying Kowloong tea art. According to the book, to achieve the best flavor, I must strictly control the brewing time.		800		50908	['About Tea', 'Goodbye']	[50906, 50909]
50908	Like the taste? Great, I will take note. We can replace some coffee with tea in future.		800			['About Entertainment', 'Goodbye']	[50902, 50909]
50909	Come try another type of tea, Commandant.	2024SpringNpc_Li_Endtalk					
51001	Let's have some tea together.	Talk_Idle	800			['About Desserts', 'About Flowers', 'Goodbye']	[51002, 51005, 51008]
51002	I found this little heater. We can sit around it and bake some desserts.		800		51003	['About Desserts', 'Goodbye']	[51002, 51008]
51003	Hmm... This time is a little different. I didn't prepare the desserts beforehand, because I wanted to make them with you while sitting around the heater.		800		51004	['About Desserts', 'Goodbye']	[51002, 51008]
51004	Making something with you has always been my wish. I wished for it last year, and this year too.		800			['About Flowers', 'Goodbye']	[51005, 51008]
51005	Sitting here, we can see the blooming flowers simply by looking up.		800		51006	['About Flowers', 'Goodbye']	[51005, 51008]
51006	Look, there's another white plum hidden over there.		800		51007	['About Flowers', 'Goodbye']	[51005, 51008]
51007	I have always wanted to enjoy the blossoms in the courtyard with you, Commandant. Now, that wish has come true.		800			['About Desserts', 'Goodbye']	[51002, 51008]
51008	Could you pick a white plum flower for me, Commandant?	2024SpringNpc_Lifu_Endtalk					
51101	Have a seat.	Talk_Idle	800			['About Spring Festival', 'About Holiday', 'Goodbye']	[51102, 51105, 51108]
51102	Spring Festival is one of the most important festivals in Kowloong. Every year, people would return home during this time to reunite with their families and celebrate the arrival of a new year.		800		51103	['About Spring Festival', 'Goodbye']	[51102, 51108]
51103	"""Family"" is a distant memory to me, as I can't really recall any other family members apart from you. But thinking about it, Kowloong is just like my second home."		800		51104	['About Spring Festival', 'Goodbye']	[51102, 51108]
51104	This is more than enough for me.		800			['About Holiday', 'Goodbye']	[51105, 51108]
51105	You're right. After dedicating so much time to the reconstruction of Kowloong, maybe it's time for me to take a break.		800		51106	['About Holiday', 'Goodbye']	[51105, 51108]
51106	We sit by the pond to enjoy some tea while listening to the snowfall and appreciating the flowers. That does sound like an excellent day.		800		51107	['About Holiday', 'Goodbye']	[51105, 51108]
51107	Why not relax a little with me?		800			['About Spring Festival', 'Goodbye']	[51102, 51108]
51108	Have something to do? Alright, you should go then.	2024SpringNpc_Qu_Endtalk					
51201	One, two... more stuff to put in my mini vault!	Talk_Idle	800			['About Red Packets', 'About the Competition', 'Goodbye']	[51202, 51205, 51208]
51202	This year, I received a lot of red packets again. But I'm already a grown up...		800		51203	['About Red Packets', 'Goodbye']	[51202, 51208]
51203	Huh, why are you here? You didn't see anything, did you?		800		51204	['About Red Packets', 'Goodbye']	[51202, 51208]
51204	Why are you holding a red packet too? Is it for me? Um... I'll still take it! Thanks, Commandant!		800			['About the Competition', 'Goodbye']	[51205, 51208]
51205	Perfect timing, Commandant! There's an eating contest going on. Team up with me!		800		51206	['About the Competition', 'Goodbye']	[51205, 51208]
51206	What's the contest about? Participants need to eat the food in every single stall on this street. There will be amazing prizes if we can finish the first!		800		51207	['About the Competition', 'Goodbye']	[51205, 51208]
51207	Hey, don't turn me down. It's a Kowloong tradition! The more you can eat, the luckier you will be in the next year... Believe me, it's true!		800			['About Red Packets', 'About the Competition', 'Goodbye']	[51202, 51205, 51208]

51303	Let's follow the tradition and set off some firecrackers! They will blast away all the bad luck in the past and bring us a brilliant new year as bright as the red wrapping.		800		51304	['About Spring Festival', 'Goodbye']	[51302, 51308]
51304	The firecrackers will cast away all the gloom. Wish you all the best in the new year, Commandant.		800			['About Food', 'Goodbye']	[51305, 51308]
51305	In the past, I wasn't always able to celebrate this festival in such a peaceful way. But I would always prepare some food to share with my friends.		800		51306	['About Food', 'Goodbye']	[51305, 51308]
51306	It's not exactly a Kowloong tradition, more of a personal habit. I just wish everyone could live the life they want happily ever after.		800		51307	['About Food', 'Goodbye']	[51305, 51308]
51307	I made this dessert myself, Commandant. Would you like to try it?		800			['About Spring Festival', 'Goodbye']	[51302, 51308]
51308	May we all have a healthy and peaceful year.	2024SpringNpc_Hanying_Endtalk					
51401	Do you have any special plans today, Commandant?	Talk_Idle	800			['About Leisure', 'About Festivals', 'Goodbye']	[51402, 51405, 51408]
51402	Commandant? I'm not on any mission right now. Balancing life and work is an essential part of our routine. During holidays like this, we must rest to live and work better.		800		51403	['About Leisure', 'Goodbye']	[51402, 51408]
51403	"I'm reading ""An Overview of Kowloong's New Year Culture and Traditions"". Would you like to read it with me? It's full of interesting festive practices and traditions. I think you'd find it just as intriguing as I do."		800		51404	['About Leisure', 'Goodbye']	[51402, 51408]
51404	Can you see it from my screen? Good, we can read it together.		800			['About Festivals', 'Goodbye']	[51405, 51408]
51405	We must not forget safety even on festive holidays. Are you thinking of taking a walk over there...? Would you like me to accompany you?		800		51406	['About Festivals', 'Goodbye']	[51405, 51408]
51406	Before the festival, I considered many ways to protect you on such occasions, but none of them seemed as reliable as staying by your side.		800		51407	['About Festivals', 'Goodbye']	[51405, 51408]
51407	We can get going if you don't mind.		800			['About Leisure', 'Goodbye']	[51402, 51408]

51502	What's the most exciting part of Kowloong's New Year? Firecrackers, of course! I've got a huge box of them ready. Come on, Commandant!		800		51503	['About Fireworks', 'Goodbye']	[51502, 51509]
51503	Careful, I'm about to set them off! What did you say? I can't hear you... Opposite? What's opposite?		800		51504	['About Fireworks', 'Goodbye']	[51502, 51509]
51504	Whoa! Why are all the firecrackers flying out of the box? Watch out, Commandant!		800			['About the Pond', 'Goodbye']	[51505, 51509]
51505	See that pond over there? I have already checked it. There are fish inside!		800		51506	['About the Pond', 'Goodbye']	[51505, 51509]
51506	But you know what? Wanshi sat there for hours but didn't catch anything! Hahaha!		800		51507	['About the Pond', 'Goodbye']	[51505, 51509]
51507	He looked so pathetic, so I snuck under water, caught a big fish, and hooked it onto his line...		800		51508	['About the Pond', 'Goodbye']	[51505, 51509]
51508	That still counts, right? Hehe!		800			['About Fireworks', 'Goodbye']	[51502, 51509]
51509	Got something else going on? Sure. Just remember to come play with me later!	2024SpringNpc_Shenwei_Endtalk					
51601	Hibernating. Please leave me alone... Hmm? Commandant?	Talk_Idle	800			['About Making Wishes', 'About Fishing', 'Goodbye']	[51602, 51605, 51608]
51602	Hmm, it's been quite busy these past few days. Seems like many people are making wishes here... Perhaps that's one of the Spring Festival traditions too.		800		51603	['About Making Wishes', 'Goodbye']	[51602, 51608]
51603	But is it really going to bring them good luck at this point of time? I don't think I would rely on that to fulfill my own wishes.		800		51604	['About Making Wishes', 'Goodbye']	[51602, 51608]
51604	Still, if you are willing to tell me your wish, it might actually come true today... Who knows?		800			['About Fishing', 'Goodbye']	[51605, 51608]
51605	I just finished a mission. It completely drained me, so I was going to ask for a long-term hibernation.		800		51606	['About Fishing', 'Goodbye']	[51605, 51608]
51606	Right before that, Kamui told me about some interesting activities happening here, so I thought I'd come take a look...		800		51607	['About Fishing', 'Goodbye']	[51605, 51608]
51607	I like fishing because it's quiet and peaceful. But... does this pond even have fish in it?		800			['About Making Wishes', 'Goodbye']	[51602, 51608]
51608	Are you leaving already? Hmm... alright then. Wake me up whenever you come back.	2024SpringNpc_Wanshi_Endtalk					
51701	Come taste this, Commandant!	Talk_Idle	800			['About Taste', 'About Holiday', 'Goodbye']	[51702, 51705, 51708]
51702	Have you tried the fish? I cooked it. For a fish this big, I need to put extra seasonings in the dish, so I added chili peppers and fermented black beans. How was it? Pretty good, right?		800		51703	['About Taste', 'Goodbye']	[51702, 51708]
51703	I read in a Kowloong book that during this festival, you must eat fish as it is a symbol of abundance...		800		51704	['About Taste', 'Goodbye']	[51702, 51708]
51704	Abundance year after year... Hmm, I guess it means we will always have plenty to eat? Doesn't sound too bad, huh?		800			['About Holiday', 'Goodbye']	[51705, 51708]
51705	Why do you still look so rushed...? Don't tell me you are still on missions! Does Babylonia not give commandants holidays?		800		51706	['About Holiday', 'Goodbye']	[51705, 51708]
51706	No other missions, huh... Great, you really should take a rest today! Just wander around in the courtyard and slack off!		800		51707	['About Holiday', 'Goodbye']	[51705, 51708]

51802	Commandant, there was heavy snow last night. The ground is all covered in snow now, which makes it the perfect opportunity to build snowmen! Come on, I have already rolled a snowball.		800		51803	['About Making Snowmen', 'Goodbye']	[51802, 51808]

51901	I need to take note of more Kowloong traditions.	Talk_Idle	800			['About Firecrackers', 'About Outfit', 'Goodbye']	[51902, 51905, 51908]
51902	Here are the firecrackers I prepared. Please set them off, Commandant.		800		51903	['About Firecrackers', 'Goodbye']	[51902, 51908]
51903	According to Kowloong's New Year customs, people set off firecrackers in order to drive away the Nian beast. While my database indicates no evidence of such a creature, my analysis of Kowloong's cultural traditions suggests that this activity envisions the repulsion of misfortune and the arrival of good fortune.		800		51904	['About Firecrackers', 'Goodbye']	[51902, 51908]
51904	Therefore, please continue setting off the firecrackers. No need to worry about the possible debris it creates—I'll ensure the ground is promptly and thoroughly cleaned afterward.		800			['About Outfit', 'Goodbye']	[51905, 51908]
51905	Rest assured that my frame is functioning normally. The low-temperature environment won't affect me.		800		51906	['About Outfit', 'Goodbye']	[51905, 51908]
51906	However, I've noticed that the temperature of your extremities is quite low... Do you need to go back and change into warmer clothing?		800		51907	['About Outfit', 'Goodbye']	[51905, 51908]
51907	Alternatively, you can also hold my hand. I can set the temperature of my frame a little higher... Do you feel more comfortable now?		800			['About Firecrackers', 'Goodbye']	[51902, 51908]

52501	Do you like this type of lantern, Commandant?	Talk_Idle	800			['About Lanterns', 'About Ice Cream', 'Goodbye']	[52502, 52505, 52508]
52502	These floating lanterns are so delicate... Back in the Arctic, rivers were often frozen, so we never had the chance to make such beautiful lanterns.		800		52503	['About Lanterns', 'Goodbye']	[52502, 52508]
52503	But we did make ice sculptures occasionally. Have you seen ice sculptures before? Some of my skillful sisters could make truly impressive ones. They even had space inside for candles.		800		52504	['About Lanterns', 'Goodbye']	[52502, 52508]
