As if to prove his determination, he has filled the book with black-and-white sketches.

The starry sky he once abandoned is now covered in colors, resting quietly on the last page of the notebook.

On the note is a list of grocery items, the snacks she wanted to make, the food you love, Clothes and daily supplies you needed... Everything except for things she needed. It seems like she sent you the photo by mistake when she was making preparations.

24000007	1	Pulao's Candy	An item Pulao sent along with the Activation Date mail.	A candy figure Pulao made following a traditional recipe long lost. Apparently, the sugar syrup used to make the candy was infused with different herbs and Chinese medicine, giving it energy-recovering properties and all sorts of health benefits. Pulao was going to sell the candy, but she might have been too heavyhanded with the ingredients, and the sugar would not melt no matter what... Still, that means it can be in your possession forever and ever.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconTools/ItCharBirthday07.png	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/IconToolsSp/ItCharBirthday07Sp.png	5	99994

24000009	1	Chac-Chac	An item Sophia sent along with the Activation Date mail.	A pair of Akdilek instruments gifted by Sophia. They make a pleasant sound when you shake them, providing the beat for music and dance. She never thought she would be dancing at a ball. Controlling her body's movement was much more difficult than controlling machines. Still, she found herself enjoying it somehow. The one thing she remembers the most about that moment was the rhythm her partner made with the maracas. She no longer has a chance to dance lately. She wants to keep this wonderful instrument at your place for now while she looks forward to dancing with her partner and the shakers once again in the future.

24000010	1	Warrior's Greatsword	An item Kamui sent along with the Activation Date mail.	"A common weapon used in popular RPGs during the Golden Age. A replica like this has not been manufactured for a long time, so this is probably one of Kamui's prized processions. A line is engraved on the sword: ""All in war with time"". He has given you his sword, alongside his passion, courage, and faith unreservedly."

24000011	1	Takeaway	An item Camu sent along with the Activation Date mail.	The standard lunchbox given out by Babylonia. After some modifications from Camu, the box looks distinctive and iconic, with its insulating alloy keeping the takeaway inside at the desired temperature. There are a few cheese hotteok in the first layer, and Camu's favorite nightmare-spicy golden egg fried rice is in the second. It does seem to be a dinner he originally prepared for himself. But if that was the case, why is the food not double-spicy the way Camu likes?

24000012	1	Moon Rock	An item Luna sent along with the Activation Date mail.	"An unpolished rock the size of a palm. Based on Luna's letter, this rock comes from the surface of the Moon. It was delivered among other packages for Babylonia, so it was thoroughly inspected, and no sign of the Punishing Virus was detected. Supposedly, some stones would glisten like the Moon in the past, earning them the name ""moonstone."" Meanwhile, this rock only glows ever so slightly, but its light is significantly warmer than the moonlight. Two Moons converged—and this is who she is now."

24000013	1	"Ticket To ""Don Giovanni"""	An item Vera sent along with the Activation Date mail.	"An opera ticket sold by WGAA. The name of the opera and the showtime are printed on it. Despite WGAA's effort to update it for a modern audience, ""Don Giovanni"" still has a low turnout. The fact that this showing is taking place at 5:30 in the evening means there is barely any audience. Still, Vera will be waiting in that quiet, empty corner until the curtain falls."

24000015	1	A Container That Won't Forget	An item Bambinata sent along with the Activation Date mail.	"The decoration on this small container was hand-crafted by Bambinata, inspired by the container that Vanessa customized for her. There is a brand-new notebook inside that she can write down the memorable moments. Bambinata once mentioned her ""treasure box"" that stored those things that were important to her at different times. Even if she has forgotten their origins when she sees them again, she never doubts their significance as long as they are in that box. Some memories last longer, while some are quickly forgotten. Bambinata gave you this container that she used to fight forgetfulness, in the hope that you can preserve as many important memories as possible."

24000017	1	Yesterday's Catch	An item Rosetta sent along with the Activation Date mail.	You sailed to the sea with Rosetta in the whispers of the waves under the starry night.

You figured out the answer spontaneously seeing the local residents waving at her on the shore.

24000020	1	Whispers Of Valley Pines	An item Qu sent along with the Activation Date mail.	"Along with Qu's reply came an ancient scroll painting of Kowloong. Judging by the signature, this artwork is a millennium old. ""In moss and dew, the dawn is bathed. Through veiled art, our souls are weighed. Upon the stones, pure waters rest. Through myriad valleys, pine winds wade."" Anyone witnessing its beauty would surely be spellbound. It captures a moment in the Kowloong history, a serenity Qu will always aspire to but never quite reach."

24000021	1	Beats & Beach Record: First Edition	An item No. 21 sent along with the Activation Date mail.	The CD's cover alone transports you back to the heights of summer passion. Long-forgotten beats and melodies surge to life at its mere sight. Rumor has it that this first edition CD was made exclusively for Beats & Beach attendees, with very limited quantities released to the public. Clearly played numerous times, it seems No. 21 has relived cherished memories with this time and again. Wait... there's a subtle scratch on the back. Could it be... teeth marks?

Made by Changyu himself, this Kowloong breakfast features many differently shaped food items in the steamer, but they all taste pretty good.

24000024	2	Oasis	An item Watanabe sent along with the Activation Date mail.	This tenacious and lively green color amidst the sands still has morning dew on it. Perhaps such color is not a rare sight in Babylonia, but to Watanabe, it is a precious symbol of the hope for the future. The sweetness within can only be tasted by those who have gone through considerable hardship.

24000025	2	Stacking Dolls	An item Roland sent along with the Activation Date mail.	"These dolls were crafted with reference to you-know-who, but the innermost figure is a young boy you have never seen. He does give you a familiar feel, which is probably an illusion. Remember that saying? ""Life is like a bunch of dolls stacked together."" Fake images are wrapped inside reality, but reality is concealed by more illusions. After peeling away all the layers, all that remains is emptiness and bitterness. Perhaps to the sender, their life is just like these dolls—so fragile and light that you can hold them in your hands."

24000026	2	Dreamcatcher Chime	An item Wanshi sent along with the Activation Date mail.	This delicate hand-crafted dreamcatcher is attached to several wind chimes that can make ethereal melodies.

With his important one around, Wanshi no longer needs the dreamcatcher to bring him sweet dreams.

24000033	2	Simple Stew	An item Lucia sent along with the Activation Date mail.	"Prepared by Lucia herself, this home-cooked dish can finally be safely consumed, although the taste is rather bland as her past experiences have made her overly cautious with seasoning. It is a sign that she is gradually beginning to ""live"" her life, as it is no longer solely occupied by cruel battles. The days of wandering without supplies are gone. She has learned how to appreciate the details of everyday life with her important ones."

24000034	2	Ancient Talisman	An item Alpha sent along with the Activation Date mail.	Alpha stumbled upon this talisman in an ancient temple during her journey. When she found it, every other object nearby had already decayed with time, except this one that lay intact among the dry leaves. Wandering travelers never needed this talisman to pray for safety, but when Alpha saw it, the first thing that came to her mind was a human who was just as tenacious. She hopes you can safely arrive at the end and stand before her once again, regardless of whether you will end up as comrades or enemies.

Amidst Gray Raven's relentless combat missions, this unassuming little robot undergoes continuous technical enhancements, with each update regarded as a testament to its ""growth."" Primarily, it mirrors the seriousness and reliability of its creator, but occasionally, harmless bugs emerge, resulting in moments where it may circle around you, silently gazing up. In those instances, it seems to imply that visiting the maker directly for a fix would be the optimal solution."

24000036	2	Lovers' Hairpin I	An item Hanying sent along with the Activation Date mail.	A Kowloong accessory that has seemingly been split into halves. On the note that came with it is a gracefully handwritten poem: At the ferry of peach leaves, we part with a shared hairpin's grace. Haze veils the weeping willows, as we bid farewell, hearts embrace. Climbing the stairs, trepidation takes hold of me, witnessing the tempest's might, petals set free. None to hush the orioles' mournful serenade, their song endures as sorrows cascade.

A health check-up report provided by the Star of Life, accompanied by Liv's handwritten notes on its back about medical advice, precautions, recommendations for regulating daily habits, and dietary suggestions... This monthly report is routinely sent to the commandant, and Liv always provides thoughtful advice and reminders. It just so happens that it was sent today this month. Despite its regularity, Liv takes each one with utmost seriousness, regardless of time, her own well-being, or distance.

The components originated from Asslam, while the gemstone was gifted by Jamilah. From a merchant's perspective, the box and the precious gem may seem incongruous. However, to Sophia, it holds cherished memories from her time with the Maintenance Crew, while the gemstone symbolizes the choices she has made since becoming a Construct, both carrying profound significance and equal value. Unsure if this gift holds immeasurable worth, Sophia willingly presents all she possesses to you, carrying indescribable emotions within her heart.
