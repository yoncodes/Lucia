10103	3	10102	Empty Library	It's more realistic to look for books to burn than food to eat in this place.		[1, 2]		[101030]	
10104	7	10103	Riverside Camp	There is smoke rising from the stones. Could it be the Corrupted? Or the campfire made by survivors?		[3, 4]		[101040]	
10105	20	10103	Run-Down Slum	I can hear people crying even from the outside. I'm afraid the situation is worse than we expected... Should we accept them? Or put an end to their misery...?	True	[3, 4]		[101050]	
10106	6	10102	Crowded Street	There are burns on every car on this crowded street. Apparently, their owners didn't have the chance to drive them out of the city.		[1, 2]		[101060]	
10107	11	10106	Quiet Bomb Shelter	It's hard to imagine how this bomb shelter has survived everything. However, we could find something we need here...		[1, 2]		[101070]	
10108	14	10107	Collapsed Skyscraper	The ruins look like the corpse of a giant. No matter what's in there, it will definitely not be pleasant.	True	[3, 4]		[101080]	
10201	1		Urban Area B						
10202	6		Signal Station	Recently, we have found the signal tower under the ruins. But the huge signal tower now only has a fragile, damaged base left standing in the center of the city.		[1, 2]		[102020]	
10203	5	10202	High-End Residential Area	Despite the broken columns at the entrance, the delicate architecture still looks amazing. If it hadn't been the disaster, it would have been a dream come true to live there.		[1, 2]		[102030]	
10204	3	10203	Fine Dining Restaurant	It's said that it was a popular fine dining restaurant, famous for its huge number of underground cold storage rooms and its wide range of food in store.		[1, 2, 3, 4]		[102040]	
10205	20	10203	Two-Story House	This small building looks almost intact. It's just that sometimes there are strange cries coming out from it. Are there any Scavengers in there? Or it is another trap?		[1, 2]		[102050]	
10206	7	10204	Quiet Cabin	There is still a faint light coming out from this clean little cabin, making it stand out among the black ruins around it.	True	[1, 2]		[102060]	
10207	19	10206	Convenience Store Ruins	It offers fewer choices of items than a supermarket but is enough to fulfill your daily needs.		[1, 2]		[102070]

10209	12	10202	Supermarket in Mist	Is it because of the terrain? This place is full of mist. Hope we can find the supermarket marked on the map before using up our supplies.		[1, 2]		[102090]	
10210	9	10209	Collapsed School	The disaster didn't show mercy to this place even though there was the hope of the inheritance of human civilization behind that wall. This is a fact that we learned a long time ago.		[1, 2]		[102100]	
10211	14	10209	Wasteland	The Punishing Virus broke out before any construction plan was able to be carried out here.		[1, 2]		[102110]	
10212	11	10211	City Hospital	"Were it not for the bold characters on the map, no one would know that this black burnt ""pile of dirt"""" used to be a """"hospital."""	True	[3, 4]		[102120]	
10213	4		Rocky Riverbank	The river has long dried out. There is smoke rising from the rocks. Could it be the Corrupted? Or the campfire made by Scavengers?		[1, 2]	[102130]	[102130]	
10214	10	10213	Suburban Farm	It seems the farm didn't survive the disaster even though it locates far from the city. Nevertheless, it's still a precious location for us to stay.		[1, 2]		[102140]	
10301	1		Urban Area C						
10302	5		Traveler's Cabin	This is the only intact building we see walking along the road. We can still see a faint light in it through the window. Could there still be Scavengers in there?		[3, 4]		[103020]	
10303	4		Roadside Gas Station	Apart from the convenience store that was broken open violently, this roadside gas station still remains how it looked when just abandoned.		[3, 4]		[103030]	
10304	3	10302	Industrial Park	There is a giant toy statue at the entrance to the park. Half of its face was blown off, leaving only half of its huge smile on the face.		[3, 4]		[103040]	
10305	6	10302	Abandoned Market	The degree of damage to the market makes me wonder if it was already abandoned before the disaster. Hope we can find something useful in it.		[3, 4]		[103050]	
10306	10	10303	Abandoned Port	The ships stranded on the shore have formed a natural fortress, making me wonder if there are any remaining supplies or Scavengers in the ship cabins.		[1, 2]		[103060]	
10307	13	10303	Quiet Bomb Shelter	It's hard to imagine how this bomb shelter has survived everything. However, we could find something we need here.		[1, 2]		[103070]	
10308	7	10304	Collapsed Mansion	"A mansion with astonishing design and size. If it hadn't been the disaster, it would have been the place for most of the ""upper class"" to hang out on weekends."		[1, 2]		[103080]	
10309	21	10304	Golden Farm	In the past, the farm was known for its high yield of rice and the golden rice field during harvest. Even now, we can still see the golden light of the farm under the sun from afar.	True	[3, 4]		[103090]	
10310	16	10306	Armed Dwelling	It's said that there are a group of armed Scavengers with sufficient supplies here... Hope I can negotiate with them and get us some supplies. However, if things go sideways... I think I'd better bring a weapon with me...	True	[3, 4]		[103100]	
10311	11	10307	Empty Trench	The air is full of the bad smell of burnt bodies. Fortunately, we didn't find any traces of the Corrupted around here. I thought I was already used to the smell of death, but I still feel like throwing up standing here...		[1, 2]		[103110]	
10312	18	10307	Forest Valley	The ruts full of water stretch all the way into the valley. After observation, we find traces of tents in the woods. Perhaps we can find some Scavengers here.		[1, 2]		[103120]	
10313	19	10308	Abandoned Mine	The complex structure of the tunnels provides a good shelter for the Scavengers. However, even the thick stone walls can't stop the burnt smell of flesh from coming out. It won't look good in there. Should we still go in there?		[1, 2]		[103130]	
10314	8		Riverside Camp	"It seems the river has dried out a long time ago. The black ""corpses"" of the burnt trees have created a natural wall for this place, making it hard for us to see what is going on in the camp. Maybe we should take a closer look."	True	[3, 4]	[103140]	[103140]	
10315	15		Orchard	This place used to be a productive orchard with rivers full of fish floating through. Now there are only broken, bare, burnt branches... Is it possible to find any supplies or Scavengers here?		[3, 4]	[103150]	[103150]	
10316	15		Orchard	This place used to be a productive orchard with rivers full of fish floating through. Now there are only broken, bare, burnt branches... Is it possible to find any supplies or Scavengers here?		[3, 4]	[103160]	[103160]

10402	5		Empty Trench	The air is full of the bad smell of burnt bodies. Fortunately, we didn't find any traces of the Corrupted around here. I thought I was already used to the smell of death, but I still feel like throwing up standing here...		[1, 2]		[104020]	
10403	4		Crowded Street	There are burns on every car on this crowded street. Apparently, their owners didn't have the chance to drive them out of the city.		[1, 2]		[104030]	
10404	3	10402	Camp Amidst Woods	From the outside, the camp seems to be well stocked with supplies. Maybe there are survivors. Even if they don't want to join us, at least we can try if we can get some food or other resources from them.		[1, 2]		[104040]	
10405	6	10402	Supermarket	Most of the windows have lost their glass. It looks like this place has been bombarded or ransacked by other Scavengers, or both. We can only imagine what the place looked like with the broken sign left here.		[3, 4]		[104050]	
10406	8	10402	Bloody Church	There is blood and unidentified remains everywhere. Wait. Did you hear that? Was it the bells... from up there...?		[1, 2]		[104060]	
10407	7	10404	Cabin Amidst Woods	The creaks of the broken door can scare people off even in the broad daylight.		[3, 4]		[104070]	
10408	21	10404	Quiet Bomb Shelter	It's hard to imagine how this bomb shelter has survived everything. However, we could find something we need here.	True	[3, 4]		[104080]

10503	6	10502	Lab Building	The building is like the second landmark of the city. You can see it from anywhere in the city without going to the overlook point. However, there is a strange defensive line before the building. No one is guarding there anymore.				[105030]	
10504	4	10502	Armed Dwelling	My friends tell me that there are a group of armed Scavengers with sufficient supplies here... Hope I can negotiate with them and get us some supplies. However, if things go sideways... I think I'd better bring a weapon with me...				[105040]	
10505	3	10502	Radio Station	The radio station is also a mess, but we could find some useful information here.				[105050]	
10506	12	10503	Strange Opening	There is a big hole in the ground. I can smell gasoline and a fishy odor when standing close to it. When I look into the hole, it looks like a huge bottomless abyss that has been holding the secret behind the destruction of the conservation area.				[105060]	
10507	20	10503	Quarantine Area	There is a biohazard sign at the entrance to the quarantine area. Everything inside seems to be ruined. Could we find anything useful in a place like this?				[105070]	
10508	14	10506	Underground Lab	What appears before us is a giant lab. No matter who created this place, that person must be supported by a powerful organization.				[105080]	
10509	11	10508	Hidden Room	This metal wall in the lab is full of scratches. It sounds weird when we knock on the wall. There must be a hidden space behind it.				[105090]	
10510	13	10509	Outer City	Behind the lab is a channel leading to the outside of the city. The faint light at the end of the tunnel tells us that the dark night of the city will pass soon.				[105100]	
10511	7	10505	Residential Area	The density of buildings here suggests that it was a busy area, but now there is only dead silence.				[105110]	
10512	8	10511	Supermarket in Mist	Is it because of the terrain? This place is full of mist. Hope we can find the supermarket marked on the map before using up our supplies.				[105120]

20101	2	20100	Quiet Apartment	Even though most of the paint has come off the walls and revealed the bloody red bricks, the building still remains in good shape. Hope there is something we can use inside it.		[1, 2]		[2010100]	
20102	3	20101	Camp Amidst Woods	If it were not for the flash of light at night, we wouldn't have found this camp. It's well hidden. In other words, it's a perfect shelter.	True	[1, 2]		[2010200]	
20103	4	20102	Roadside Gas Station	From the outside, the roadside gas station still looks abandoned. Even the door of the convenience store deep inside is closed. Everything is peaceful and quiet.	True	[4]		[2010300]	
20104	5	20103	Wastewater Treatment Plant	"This distorted building is the Golden Age wastewater treatment plant marked on the map. However, it is the only building that still looks like a ""building"" in the area."	True	[1, 2]		[2010400]	
20105	6	20104	Suburban Quarantine Station	The quarantine station is located far away from the city center, which is probably the reason why it is still in a good state.

20106	7	20102	Resource Landfill Site	"... Compared to the weird Red Tide and the smell of blood, the smell of this landfill site is rather ""pleasant"". It could hold some useful supplies. A place worth exploring."	True	[2]		[2010600]	
20107	8	20101	Empty Trench	We can smell gunpowder even from a distance. Thankfully, we haven't seen any traces of the Corrupted around here. Should we take a look?	True	[1, 2, 3, 4]		[2010700]	
20108	9	20107	Battlefield Ruins	One can still see a pile of the remains of the Corrupted in the center of the battlefield even from a distance. In other words, if it is safe enough, it must hold many usable supplies.		[1, 2]		[2010800]	
20109	10	20100	Community Hospital	There is dim light coming out through the windows. Are the Scavengers who escaped from the forest camp staying here?	True	[1, 2, 3, 4]	[20109]	[2010900]	
20110	11	20109	Suburban Signal Station	The huge signal station only has its damaged base remaining, which looks like a giant's body with its upper half missing. It stands vulnerably and firmly in the wilderness.	True	[1, 2]		[2011000]	
20111	12	20110	Southern Woods	From the outside, we can see the wet ruts extending deep into the forest. Perhaps we can find some survivors by following the ruts.	True	[1, 2]		[2011100]
