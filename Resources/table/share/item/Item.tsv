80005	Caldwell - 49	Oathbound — Levi-Gun	"This Levi-Gun was named after a rose in a far-off galaxy. The universe was dubbed the ""ultimate romance"" during the Golden Age.

80006	White Acclaim	Oathbound — Bow	As the name suggests, this is a ceremonial rather than a practical weapon. Instead of a raging battlefield, it belongs in a sacred or peaceful setting.

80008	Star of Bethlehem	New Life — Greatsword	A greatsword that resembles a Christmas tree. The Star of Bethlehem is stuck tightly on the tip, so tight that not even a fierce swing can shake it off.

80012	Lion Glory	Yesterday Once More — Gunblade	Lion Glory is the name of the weapon equipped by outstanding F.O.S. graduates. Its name originates from the lion-like deep roar when it is swung.

80014	Shadowforged — Dying Light	Festival — Katana	With only traces of material applied in a special coating process, this blade has a crimson glow like a setting sun.

80022	Gray Moon Embrace	Paradise Lost — Gunblade	A weapon that cuts through the red tide as if desiring to drink all the blood of its enemies.

Its unique design also makes it look more like a cushion than a weapon.

Even the designer ended up falling victim to it.

After a short silence, the audience bursts into cheers—Being good at singing is not the only standard for the new generation of idols.

80034	Theros' Bloom	Ocean Secret — Banner Spear	In order to protect the maiden from the scorching light, its panels open as if a flower blooms, occupying a space exclusively for her. Maintaining a low profile, the maiden looks for something that can arouse her interest along with the flow of music, until a person meets her gaze and instantly turns away. The maiden knows it is time to use its another function. She folds the panels down and hurls it like a javelin. It pierces into the ground right before the commandant.

Now, it sports a rabbit motif, because, well, ""a weapon should reflect its master."" Swing it down hard, and the whoosh of air is like the booming thunder of spring.

80105	Blade Skewer	Ocean Secret — Pyro Katana	"How much salt? Oh, a whole bottle! And pepper? ""To taste""... What is ""to taste""? Next, ""brush it with cooking oil""... That's too slow.

80106	Wild Hunt	Paradise Lost — Shield Axe	The sun was scorching. The land was burning. The wind was howling with yellow sand. Startrail fought the beast head-on with her incredible shield and axe. Ho! Ha! They fought like that for three days! And? And the bad guys were chased away. The sand storm stopped. And peace was restored. Thank you, Startrail!

80108	Wrathvanquish	Fairy Garment — Dual-Bladed Lance	Across the skies that stretch endlessly deep, wailing souls are severed by this lance without a trace. Legend tells that its forger once stood atop the mountain peak and pierced the ghost lord's lingering spirit with a single strike—even heaven and earth trembled at its might. Only those of unwavering will may wield this weapon.

80110	Summer Rain-Bow	Ocean Secret — Bow	Sunlight dances on rippling water, reflecting a mirage of midsummer with the twang of strings. Colors bleed into one another, swaying with the coconut trees.

80111	Dusktide Ripples	Ocean Secret — Pyro Katana	When the clamor of the world fades into the night, a ghostly blue luminescence emerges from the abyss. Flecks of phosphorescence shimmer across the boundless sea, captivating the gaze. The maiden wades through the water, leaving ripples in her wake. She reaches out slowly, and the cold glow licks at her fingertips, scattering like celestial dust—brief, radiant, and just bright enough to banish the dark sea's solitude.

80113	Seafoam Sparkler	Ocean Secret — Fusion Gunsword	Within the smooth, streamlined barrel, a cool tension lurks in wait. A light tap of the finger, and a slender arc of water slices through the sun-woven peace, planting a glistening medal squarely upon someone's shoulder. The splashing droplets stir ripples in the lazy summer air—and so begins a game of joy, meant only for you and her.

80114	The Ordinance	Paradise Lost — Lashblade	Though the world lies shattered, the ancient laws still endure, their rigor testing the boundaries of damnation. The crimson blade sweeps through the void, severing the worldly chains that have bound countless souls. The sinful return to nothingness, while those in agony find release. In this fallen realm, death is punishment, as well as redemption.

80115	Vermilion Clangs	Fairy Garment — Longsword	"The Sparragon's Gibbous Edge sings like a phoenix, its vermilion blade thirsty for blood. According to the Kowloong Codex: Volume of Divine Arms: ""The Sparragon's vermilion blade was forged from twin souls. If the brother falls, the blade shatters; when the sister awakens, triumph shall follow."" Tempered by starlit flame, with dragon scales and sparrow feathers fused as one, this blade cleaves the old world and ushers in a new chapter with a single strike."

80116	Argent Requiem	The Godfall Revelation — Revolver	When the silver bullet pierces the skull, does the executioner feel a flicker of reluctance? Every bone nail seals shut a lingering dream that refuses to die. Roses bloom into epitaphs amid the gunfire, an elegy for noble enemies. Death is but time, rewritten once more.

80118	Moonlit Autumn	Fairy Garment — Pipa	The wood of the instrument curves, its grain a meandering stream bathed in the radiance of a thousand moons. As fingers drift over its frost-cooled strings, the notes slice through shadowed clouds to reveal the sky's clear, silent heart. A mighty resonance swells—moon-forged tones that fall like dew, soaking the dusty world below and washing its cares away. The exile, hearing this clarity, feels a soul-deep pull toward the osmanthus shadows of home; the wanderer, bathed in its glow, finds solace in memories of jade towers and marble courts. Here, the pipa is more than an instrument; it is the full moon itself, a jade wheel hung in the vault of heaven. And with every plucked string, an autumnal longing is unveiled, luminous and profound.

80119	Flawless Deception	The Godfall Revelation — Moon Umbrella	Beneath the shelter of its skeletal frame, a mirage of wealth and gilded dreams runs wild. She moves untouched between the revelry and the despair, her scornful eyes drinking in the grotesque theatre of human folly. The true grand deception—the theft from heaven itself—is measured not in profit or loss, but in the plunder of that foolish courage which springs from greed.

80120	Slumbering Sands	Wandering Ballad — Lance	Across the sea of sand, the lance stands like a stele from a forgotten age, shearing the veil between life and death. It conducts the soul-fires of the eternally exiled—those caught in futile struggle—into an absolute and final silence. Here, there are no hymns, no lamentations. Even death's last echo is swallowed by the inexorable sands, becoming mere sustenance for the void. As grit grinds on grit, all sound bleeds into stillness... This is the desert of death's most searing curse: to choose silence as the obliterating dunes consume you... or to become silence itself.

80121	Everlight Oath	Wandering Ballad — Keystaff	When eternal night draws near, the Mistress of Fate lights an undying flame. She walks through the dark corridors, sealing the glories and secrets of the past within the endless night. Through the river of time she keeps her silent watch, her crown shining like stars that never fade. She waits, for the destined one who can read the meaning behind her faint smile before time itself comes to an end.

80124	Glimpsed Grace	Fairy Garment — Lotus Wheel	A maiden walks by the stream. Moonlight slips between her fingers as lotus petals drift with the wind, brushing against the water and breaking its reflection. In that fleeting instant, beauty flashes and fades like a dream.
