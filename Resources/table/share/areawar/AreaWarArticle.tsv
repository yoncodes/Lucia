3	1	3	5	100	Student ID 1600	First	First comment!\nThe supply point is easy to clear. I heard from a senior before that the graduation exam always lacks supplies, probably to save face in front of the observers.\nBut according to the way some teachers set the questions, it may become very difficult afterward.\nAnyway, remember to prepare enough resources. Good luck, everyone.		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiAreaWar/UiAreaWarStory03.png
4	1	4	7	100	Student ID 1569	Thank you	Thanks to those who came to help!\nIt's my first time requesting for dispatch. I thought I'd be able to handle it alone, but I didn't want to fail early on so I had to call for backup in the end... I guess the teachers wanted to emphasize the importance of teamwork with this test. Co-op missions are also important in the area, so don't refuse to accept help and not request for dispatch.

5	1	5	10	100	Student ID 1495	It hurts...	I got hit by a stray bullet when doing the Special Mission. Currently using my aching arm to write this message, I can't even move my shoulder. Fortunately, I can still fight.\nI feel like the pain simulation module has been amped up to 5 (?) this time... Be careful, everyone.\nLuckily, someone was kind enough to patch me up.\nSmall edit: Turns out, everyone else's modules were set to 7, the teacher just came over to adjust mine.\nNothing else to add to this thread.

6	2	1	14	100	Student ID 1499	Lost my recording device	It was quite chaotic when I was raiding the Dark Block and I lost my recording device. Now I can't upload my records. I hope this won't affect my grades...\nRequesting for a new device requires time. If anyone finds my device, please return it to me!\nI'll do anything!

7	2	2	16	100	Student ID 1442	Regarding standard pistols	Everyone knows not to choose pistols when choosing weapons since we're taught that pistols lack stability, precision, and range compared to other weapons in battle.\nBut I've changed my mind after watching a graduation exam record footage of a senior. I am also going to become a pistol master.\nMy scores have improved quite a lot in pistol simulation training recently, and now it's time to put my skills to the test!\nEdit: There are quite a few doubters in the comments, but I've just successfully participated in a base station raid. Personally, I think the difference in weapons can be compensated by one's skills.\nEdit 2: By the way, can we change equipment or weapons at the next supply point? There's just some equipment damage, nothing wrong with pistols.		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiAreaWar/UiAreaWarStory07.png
8	2	3	18	100	Student ID 1532	Found a lost terminal	"I found a portable terminal after accepting a Support Mission. The lock screen is a character from ""Ocean Brawl"". I'm currently at the supply point, if this is your device, please come pick it up.\nOn a side note, the recent updates in ""Ocean Brawl 2"" are so good! The first one was already good but this is even better.\nIf anyone wants to get into the series, I'm in room 1077."		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiAreaWar/UiAreaWarStory08.png
9	2	4	21	100	Student ID 1444	I have understood the tactics	After a period of observation, I've found that enemies deal more damage with long-range attacks compared to close-range attacks, so the key is to close the distance with your target quickly.\nI've been hit with weapons of mass destruction before, so as long as you fortify your defenses and create geological advantages, the battle should be way easier.\nWe need to be decisive as students of F.O.S.! You're more likely to get hit by long-range attacks, close combat is the key to success.		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiAreaWar/UiAreaWarStory09.png
10	2	5	24	100	Student ID 1526	To the one who said close combat is the key to success!	I dare you to reveal yourself!!\nI almost failed because of you. Give me back my points!\nI couldn't even send out a support signal. Spreading misinformation and making random judgments can go very wrong!

11	3	1	27	100	Youth Center	Youth Center	Congratulations to all for completing this session. Well done!\nWe have collected some comments from the observation experiences in the past two weeks which we would like to pass on to all students.\nEveryone is so cool when battling! I also want to become a student at F.O.S.!\nIt's so exciting! Good luck to the guy flying the aerial vehicle!\nI have learned the values of F.O.S. students through this experience, which includes bravery, self-improvement, and solidarity. I will strive to become an F.O.S. student.\nAfter seeing the battle scenes on the surface, I have decided that I want to become a doctor at Star of Life so that fewer people will suffer in the future.

12	3	2	29	100	Student ID 1490	Wreck-It Bear friend request	As above. Since there are more people here now I thought I'd try my luck here. Is anyone in the Youth Center (can they see this thread?) playing Wreck-It Bear? Let's be friends after the exams! It's my current fixation.\nMy friend code is in the attachments.\nEdit: my friend list is full, let me reorganize my list, wait.		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiAreaWar/UiAreaWarStory04.png
13	3	3	33	100	Office of Academic Affairs, F.O.S. College	Notice	Attention attendees:\nPosting or discussing content unrelated to the test is prohibited. Offenders have been penalized.\nStudent ID 1532: muted\nStudent ID 1490: muted and deduction of points in this area.		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiAreaWar/UiAreaWarStory05.png
14	3	4	35	100	Youth Center	The importance of serum	I thought it would be a battle in the Clean Zone. Who would've guessed the simulation would include the spread of the Punishing Virus... There were a lot of people asking for serum support in the end.\nIt's not that we couldn't have pushed through it, it's just that it would've slowed down the team's progress. I guess it's true that the battlefield is ever-changing and you need to be prepared for it. If you need serum, I have some here. Hope we can all hang on till the next supply point raid.\nTap to see attachment: coordinates.		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiAreaWar/UiAreaWarStory06.png
15	3	5	38	100	Student ID 1511	Looks familiar?	I finally broke through the Dark Block.\nEveryone's probably seen videos of the surface before, right? Do you get a sense of deja vu after this test?\nI heard from our seniors that this is what happens on the surface every day. While we stand in a simulated battlefield, this is actually happening over and over again for real on the surface.\nJoining the F.O.S. was the most important decision I have ever made. I aim to graduate as valedictorian so that these kinds of tragedies don't repeat themselves anymore!		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiAreaWar/UiAreaWarStory07.png
16	4	1	41	100	Student ID 1549	Just a suggestion	We encountered a waterway during the operation, and for a landlubber like me, it was quite the challenge... Youth Center, if you can see this, please add swimming classes!\nI wonder if there are dry clothes at any supply points.\nAnd hopefully, my little brother didn't see how embarrassing I was.		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiAreaWar/UiAreaWarStory08.png
17	4	2	45	100	Student ID 1435	Professor, seriously?	My god, the Corrupted before the base station are too scary! Is this the difficulty of a mid-term test...\nEdit (4:35): What I meant was that the professor who designed this test is brilliant. All possible situations we may face on the battlefield were taken into account, can't have designed it better myself. It's not a malicious comment.\nI swear.		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiAreaWar/UiAreaWarStory09.png
18	4	3	47	100	Student ID 1417	Team up in Dark Block?	I've reached the final Dark Block but I need a team to advance.\nThere's a bit of power overflow when I tried to increase output and I also got separated from my original team, so now I need a team that has a few Tanks. Preferably, we can keep being a team until graduation.		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiAreaWar/UiAreaWarStory02.png
19	4	4	53	50	Student ID 1495	What happened??	What? Why am I the one fighting?\nI'm a part of the scout team and am mainly responsible for planning, so why is my team suddenly the team closest to the Dark Block?\nWell, it feels good to be acknowledged by those who we've saved, but it shouldn't be my turn so soon! Sigh, I guess I just need to hang on till backup arrives...		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiAreaWar/UiAreaWarStory06.png
