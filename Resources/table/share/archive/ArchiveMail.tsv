224	8	84602144	2023/5/30 10:00	121	Gift from Kamui	Kamui	Kamui's gift box: The box is filled with stickers of all sorts of flowers, with most of them being species that do not actually exist in reality.

The umbrella-shaped inflorescences only have white and pale green colors, yet their rich fragrance lingers. Inside the box is another photo of Changyu performing train maintenance with lots of engine oil stains on his clothes, taken by the maintenance team to make fun of him.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RolePlayer/RoleHeadChangyu1.png
237	8	84602157	2023/5/30 10:00	134	Gift from Wanshi	Wanshi	Wanshi's gift box: Several strands of white pagoda tree flowers are wrapped in kraft paper.

238	8	84602158	2023/5/30 10:00	135	Gift from Selena	Selena	Selena's gift box: This parcel has no sender information on it. Inside the slightly dated but still clean eco box is a bouquet of blooming iris flowers, as well as a vintage cassette tape that records a romantic cello serenade. When played, you can even hear the sounds of wind brushing over petals and the chirping of birds.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RolePlayer/RoleHeadSailinna1.png
239	8	84602159	2023/5/30 10:00	136	Gift from No. 21	No. 21	No. 21's gift box: This package was delivered by Fresh Express. A white tungoil tree flower lies in the center of the box, surrounded by a variety of leaves. No. 21 probably put in every leaf that she thought was good-looking.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RolePlayer/RoleHeadR3Twentyone1.png
240	8	84602160	2023/5/30 10:00	137	Gift from Roland	Roland	Roland's gift box: A delicate string of vibrant green spider plants with a fresh scent. When examined, they seem to be artificial flowers.

It is said these are the banknotes that will be used in Pulao's gigantic business empire that she dreams of establishing. As for the amount displayed... There are a lot of zeroes.

242	8	84602162	2023/5/30 10:00	139	Gift from Haicma	Haicma	Haicma's gift box: Inside the box is a carefully wrapped lily of the same species that she once saw in the ruins during a surface mission. Apart from the flower, there is also a uniquely shaped hat that happens to possess all possible functions that one can expect: sun protection, wind resistance, water-proof, keeping warm, ventilation, and even protection against falling objects. Truly impressive.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RolePlayer/RoleHeadHakama1.png
243	8	84602163	2023/5/30 10:00	140	Gift from Noan	Noan	Noan's gift box: Wrapped in a bouquet, these blue throatwort flowers were planted by Noan while he was helping in the greenhouse.

244	8	84602164	2023/5/30 10:00	141	Gift from Bambinata	Bambinata	Bambinata's gift box: It looks more like a well decorated forget-me-not grow box than a gift container. A few small notes are attached to the inner side, with the optimal temperature and humidity for forget-me-not written on them. In the center, several pale blue buds are just about to awaken.

246	8	84602166	2023/5/30 10:00	143	Gift from Noctis	Noctis	Noctis' gift box: Encased in the cheap-looking packaging box is a bouquet of chamomile with no decoration, as well as a pair of glasses with clown eyebrows and red nose that Noctis won from the arcade center. Nobody knows how many times he challenged the puzzle game before getting them—he was never good at it.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RolePlayer/RoleHeadR2Nuoketi1.png
247	10		2023/8/24 10:00	144	Drift Bottle from Lucia	Lucia	Commandant, can I put my wish note with yours in the same bottle? Um, I want to drift in the same space and on the same sea with you.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RolePlayer/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png

253	10		2023/8/24 10:00	150	Drift Bottle from Kamui	Kamui	I even included a chip with the backup data of the game we played! Don't you think it's super cool to share the world we built together with the next person?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RolePlayer/RoleHeadShenwei1SS.png
254	10		2023/8/24 10:00	151	Drift Bottle from Wanshi	Wanshi	Um, are you relying on the sea to fulfill your wish? Don't you see that the person capable of doing this right next to you...? Feel like I'm challenged.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RolePlayer/RoleHeadWanshi1.png
255	10		2023/8/24 10:00	152	Drift Bottle from Camu	Camu	Why put your secrets in a bottle and send it to a stranger? Throw it away! If you have anything to say, say it. And I'll do the same.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RolePlayer/RoleHeadKamu1.png
256	10		2023/8/24 10:00	153	Drift Bottle from Karenina	Karenina	Hey, give me the button on your chest! Hurry! Don't get me wrong. I just want to check if quantum mechanics work…	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RolePlayer/RoleHeadR4Kalienina1.png
