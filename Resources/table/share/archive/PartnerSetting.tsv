1	16010000	1	2	No.001	Yuan Ye is the prototype of the Combat Unit Booster project. Its modularized appearance mimics traits of cloven-hooved mammals.\nAsimov claimed that the personal taste of its designer, Leonie of the WGAA, was reflected in the final product.\nOnce enough combat data is collected, it develops a combat form that uses high-speed ram and combo hits to interrupt the enemy's channeling and assist the Constructs.	999999
2	16010000	2	2	No.002	Yuan Ye reacts to fluttering fabrics. Experiments show that it responds to short-wavelength colors particularly well, a feature likely designed for detecting the Corrupted. Taunting this unit with colored fabrics is thereby forbidden.\n\nMaintenance tips: keep the unit in hibernation when not in combat. External modules are under development. Unauthorized modification is not allowed. That should be all for now.	1000001
3	16010000	3	2	No.003	Additional maintenance tips: keep it in hibernation. I repeat, keep it in hibernation. As a prototype, it needs further adjustments. Excessive operations and modifications may break the unit, so stop playing with it.\n\nSecond warning: I'll say this one last time. No unauthorized modification is allowed! Don't ask!\n\nThird warning: Never mind... Just restore it to the default setup for combat.	1000003
4	16020000	1	2	No.001	Noctua is one of the first high-precision Support Units developed by Babylonia to enhance the connection between Constructs. Its looks and behavior patterns reflect the characteristics of owls. It can provide a wide range of support in battle by triggering the radioactive structure mounted on the wings. The multi-directional camera is also helpful for reconnaissance and investigation.	1000000
5	16020000	2	2	No.002	Noctua is extremely sensitive to hot environments due to an issue with its cooling system during the early development stages. In addition to constantly chasing and harassing researchers who possess coolants, Noctua will continuously flap its wings in an attempt to extinguish any open flames it encounters. However, the airflow it creates will more likely fan the flames. This issue has been partially resolved in later adjustments, but Noctua tends to continue such behavior when not connected to a Construct. Be sure to keep Noctua from open flames when it is not attached to any Constructs.	1000002
6	16020000	3	2	No.003	To keep up with its frequent activities, the Noctua unit comes with highly effective self-repairing components. When transformed, it often spins its head around in order to mend and lubricate its joints. As a result, Noctua often serves as the children's plaything on Babylonia. The WGAA encourages it and expresses interest in developing more CUBs with similar features, while the Science Council refuses to comment.	1000004
7	16030000	1	2	No.001	Toniris, one of the first batch of high-precision bionic units developed for CUB experiment projects, shows a high degree of compatibility with Bianca: Veritas.\nIts prototype was a bionic bird made in the Golden Age to protect the environment, whose main feature was to detect climate and environmental changes. With the Science Council's modification, Toniris is capable of more detailed detection. The particle devices on its wings can also produce a large amount of electrical power.	1000005
8	16030000	2	2	No.002	"Compared with other CUBs, Toniris has stricter standards when identifying allies and only shows closeness toward individuals who have been in contact for a long time. However, Toniris also demonstrates a certain degree of aggression toward these individuals. It often lightly tears their shirt corner or pulls their hair (note: ""light"" in terms of CUB horsepower.)\nAfter multiple incidents, contact between non-essential personnel and Toniris has become restricted, although some are sad about the constraints."	1000006
9	16030000	3	2	No.003	"In the early stages of the experiment, Toniris made loud birdcalls from its throat, which were widely mistaken for thundering in Babylonia. Investigation reveals that it was a design flaw but a unique feature reserved by the WGAA.\n""Isn't it cool that it can scream directly from the throat instead of through a loudspeaker?"" Said the anonymous president of WGAA. However, this feature had to remain turned off for the official model due to protests from the field testers."	1000007
10	16030000	1	1	Background I	"The name ""Toniris"" represents ""thunder in the rain,""\nwith the imagery of a lone bionic crane flying over the vast plain, followed by thunderclouds. \nLegend says it guides the lightning."	
11	16030000	2	1	Background II	Toniris also represents the rainbow after the thunderstorm.\nIts sliver wings bring the thunder as well as the rainbow.\nAfter a flash storm, the bionic crane stops at the rainbow and caresses its tail feathers, seemingly claiming the rainbow to be its creation.	
12	16040000	1	2	No.001	"Frost Oath, a new CUB adapted by the Science Council. Its prototype is based on the centaur module, ""Lindwyrm"", that Rosetta left in Babylonia. The humanoid hybrid frame with its severe side effects has been modified, making it suitable as a CUB. The birth of Frost Oath also marks a new direction for CUB research."	1000008
13	16040000	2	2	No.002	Compared with other CUBs, Frost Oath has a stronger sense of individuality. Unlike Rosetta, who is rational and restrained, Frost Oath is more wild and unrestrained. It shows stronger enthusiasm in the open wilderness, such as snowfields or woodlands. Frost Oath has a strong sense of identity and belonging to the group, showing no mercy to enemies that violate its territory. It is bound by duty to guard its companions.	1000009
14	16040000	3	2	No.003	Based on the individual wishes of Rosetta and Frost Oath, Rosetta can quickly return to the battlefield in her centaur form. Although the effectiveness isn't what it once as, the cognitive load brought by this state has been drastically reduced. Echoing one of the design concepts of CUB, Frost Oath is not a disposable weapon but a long-term companion on the battlefield.	1000010
15	16040000	1	1	Background I	Frost Oath was named by Rosetta at Asimov's suggestion.	
16	16040000	2	1	Background II	The appearance of Frost Oath means that the Forest Guard have claimed this land as their own, forming an area of defense that no enemy can penetrate.	
17	16050000	1	2	No.001	Seeshell, originally an outdated C7 Probe from Babylonia, frequently used in ocean exploration and climate observation. Its capability is recognized after multiple CUB experiments, and it is now active in the field as a CUB.\nWhen transformed, Seeshell's four cannons can provide substantial support fire. The two fisheye lenses by its sides also offer a comprehensive view of the battlefield. By syncing those data to Constructs and the commandant in real time, Seeshell is valuable for evaluating the battle.	1000011
18	16050000	2	2	No.002	"Due to the frequent accidents that occurred during the C7 Probes' exploration missions, an engineer tries to install multiple modules on a prototype to increase its mission success rate. However, the large number of modules and their intricate connections make it impossible to mass produce.\nAs the C7 models are retired, the prototype is going to be decommissioned as well. But, during the CUB program, its outstanding damage output and scouting capability caught tester's attention, who then named it ""Seeshell""."	1000012
19	16050000	3	2	No.003	"Seeshell's appearance is the best demonstration of its abilities.\nEverything it sees and records during an ocean exploration is gathered inside its ""shell.""\nEvery time it extracts those valuable data, researchers are astonished by the mysteries of the deep sea contained in its pearl.\nIt has been recording, watching, and gathering those scattered fragments to create these pearls to help study the ocean. Now, it will observe the battlefield and help its warriors shine."	1000013
20	16060000	1	2	No.001	"Karenina once was given a black cat with the same name by Dr. Kalon, who she called ""Grandpa""—he wanted Karenina to take care of it so she learned to not always engage in conflicts. She still refuses to admit it, but this unit is probably made in the form of a black cat because of that."	1000014
21	16060000	2	2	No.002	"Due to strong resistance from Karenina, Nitor was initially given to other Task Force members for test, but the test had to terminate after receiving many complaints from most of the members. ""With all due respect, this thing is way too hot!"" ""The enemy was approaching, but it just refused to move!"" ""It bites me! Look at my brand-new hand armor!"" In the end, Karenina had no choice but to become its master."	1000015
22	16060000	3	2	No.003	"Nitor was buried in ruins in a mission by Corrupted attacks. Karenina thinks it was her fault—does she have to watch it die just like the black cat did? She screams out the name of her old cat, only to see Nitor walk out calmly from the melted ruins. ""Thank goodness, you're still alive..."" Karenina wants to give it a hug, but it scratches her in return. ""I knew it! Not cute at all!"" She can only complain."	1000016
23	16060000	1	1	Background I	The flames on Nitor's body change with its mood. They also get hotter as it continues to engage in battle.	
24	16060000	2	1	Background II	"CUB ""Nitor"" has a high level of autonomy and can often come up with unique ideas that deviate from the standard tactics."	
25	16070000	1	2	No.001	Lingya was originally a common geological exploration robot in Babylonia with Frame ID A-19. It was later modified by the Engineering Force and put into use on the battlefield. It features an in-built generator that can affect the surrounding electromagnetic field while providing support in battle. It can also be used in geological explorations.\nDon't be surprised if Lingya remains on the battlefield after the battle. It is working on another task.	1000017
26	16070000	2	2	No.002	It has always been an important subject of study for the Engineering Force to have a grasp of the lodes and geological changes on Earth. Some areas have a special magnetic field where it is hard for Levi-Detectors to work. To explore these areas, the Engineering Force opted to use a design with an in-built generator to eliminate the negative effects of magnetic field.\nTo solve the movement and energy consumption issues of the generator, the Engineering Force added other designs to it. A few iterations later, the frame looks more and more like an animal from the antelope subfamily.	1000018
27	16070000	3	2	No.003	Maybe it was because of Lingya's magnetic field interference feature, it seemed to show an attachment to the magnetic field on Earth during geological explorations.\nJust like the original geological exploration robot, Lingya was usually sent to carry out geological exploration tasks in mountains that were hard for humans and other robots to reach.\nWhen Lingya stands alone on the top of a mountain and feels pulled by the magnetic field, is it also using its wired central unit to analyze the entire look of this planet?	1000019
28	16080000	1	2	No.001	Boreas, an eagle-shaped Combat Unit Booster developed by the Science Council with bionic technology based on Cosmos Industries' military scout aircraft with the aircraft's core technology recycled. After multiple combats and adjustments, it has become highly compatible with Chrome: Glory. It is now ready to be used on the battlefield as the first CUB fully compatible with specialized frames.	1000020
29	16080000	2	2	No.002	Boreas features a scout module that can fast analyze and mark the weak points of enemies. With its external optical camouflage unit that can make it perfectly blend in with the surroundings, it is capable of scouting and firing correction over a long period of time and provides intel to support the operations of the scouts. Boreas stays hidden up high most of the time and will only come down when Chrome signals it to do so. It will flap its wings to land quietly on his shoulder and touch his fingertip with its beak.	1000021
30	16080000	3	2	No.003	"Boreas always observes and records everything on the battlefield calmly just like a sharp arrow that is ready to be shot at any minute. With its support, your attacks will be swift and accurate like a piercing cold wind. But Boreas in its storage form is easygoing, despite his fierce look. ""It won't get mad even if you pet its head repetitively. However, this could cause low-temperature damage to the coating on your hand,"" says the tester in charge of maintenance.\n""But why don't you stop petting it?""\nSeeing this, Boreas folds its wings as it has already become used to similar situations."	1000022
31	16080000	1	1	Background I	A mechanical eagle flaps its broad wings and flies past the battlefield, gathering all the image intel and data of the enemies before they notice.	
32	16080000	2	1	Background II	"""Boreas"" is the experimental designation of the new Combat Unit Boosters. At the suggestion of an Administrative Officer who participated in the project evaluation, the name has been used as the frame name of this CUB."	
33	16090000	1	2	No.001	Thorny is a mass-produced machine formerly used by the Engineering Force. Some of its traits shown during the digging operation caught the attention of the staff and it was permitted to be modified into a CUB.\nThe spikes added during the development process have granted it the ability to defend itself against the enemies and made it look more like how it looks right now.	1000023
34	16090000	2	2	No.002	"Thorny was on a terrain exploration mission with the Engineering Force during the trial period after it was modified into a CUB. However, Thorny starts to exhibit strange behaviors after the mission. For example, it would stand on its hind legs and reveal its belly without thorns to people while holding the staff member by their wrist.\n""Why is it so clingy? Has it always been like this?""\nA hot-tempered Engineering Force Construct always complains like this to the staff members at the scene while cleaning up mud-covered Thorny."	1000024
35	16090000	3	2	No.003	"As its name suggests, Thorny weighs extremely heavily when fully expanded.\nBut it is also surprisingly easy to ""pick it up"" if you hold Thorny's front paws and push its lower body to its belly.\nHowever, if you pay more attention, you can see that Thorny is always stretching the spikes on its back secretly and stabbing them on the ground to raise its body and ease the load for whoever picks it up.\n""...Does it love to be picked up?""\nThis is the only conclusion the experiment staff could draw when seeing Thorny's shaky front legs."	1000025
36	16100000	1	2	No.001	"One theory about the origin of the CUB Jet Jaeger goes like this: Its prototype was a small machine pet of Nanami, who wanted her little cat friend to grow up and become stronger, so Nanami designed and created her ""big cat""—the tiger CUB Jet Jaeger. Compared to the ""cub"" version, the ""mature"" version is more powerful in battle."	1000026
37	16100000	2	2	No.002	"Jet Jaeger seems to be maverick and mysterious just like its designer. Sometimes it will wander in the non-battle area despite its big size. As big machines could cause trouble to the daily operation of certain departments and intimidate employees who are not strong enough mentally, Babylonia has specially carried out an order to limit the occasions where large machines are allowed to enter. However, according to an informed source, Jet Jaeger will be quiet and under control if you can work up your courage and stroke its head and tail.\n""Sounds easy, but if you look into its scary eyes... Um..."""	1000027
38	16100000	3	2	No.003	"The battlefield is Jet Jaeger's playground. Its high-speed impacts and excellent ability to slash make it a regular unit in the front row and a sharp axe that can break the enemy apart. However, there are many cases where Jet Jaeger ran out of the signal detection range in the middle of a battle, though it returned to the base without a scratch.\n""It won't stop and wait for you! Stay close to it!""\nThis is what a captain will tell their subordinates when they use Jet Jaeger to fight."	1000028
39	16100000	1	1	Background I	"Jet Jaeger is a large CUB that has been classified as ""mountable"" in its written assessment, but no one really wants to do so."	
40	16100000	2	1	Background II	We don't know whether it is due to its original program, but Jet Jaeger loves to stand by in dark, narrow places.	
41	16110000	1	2	No.001	"Moonhopper is the ""quietest"" CUB, not because the animal it was inspired by rarely made sounds, but because audio devices are redundant in space combat. Despite its low-key sound profile, when it expands its body and creates a force field, it can easily become everyone's focus on the battlefield."	1000029
42	16110000	2	2	No.002	Moonhopper's long ears are a pair of enhanced long-distance signal interaction devices that further strengthen control and communication stability in space missions. Therefore, they were definitely not designed to be cute or for patting. The reason for its rabbit-like appearance is that in certain myths and folktales, rabbits and the Moon have always been linked together. They are a perfect match in every human's heart.	1000030
43	16110000	3	2	No.003	"Moonhopper was given to Karenina on behalf of the Engineering Force by Teddy to accompany her on her mission to the Moon. She thought Karenina was going to hate it at first, but Karenina took it without making a fuss.\nBut when she saw Karenina with it again, she was surprised to see that Karenina had completely modified its face.\n""I didn't know CUBs could be made to look like their owner. What a scientific miracle.""\n""It's more befitting for it to help me in battle!"" Karenina's face showed the same expression as it did."	1000031
44	16110000	1	1	Background I	Moonhopper has a bad temper. If it stomps its feet, stay away!\nFortunately, it doesn't bite...	
45	16110000	2	1	Background II	Supposedly, the position of a rabbit's ears can be used to determine its mood. However, that doesn't apply to Moonhopper. It's never been in a bad mood.	
46	16120000	1	2	No.001	CUB Shimmer was originally designed by Kurono to be a mass-produced carrier that can carry the aero foot pedals made for individual combats. However, the model, after being made bigger, showed poor stability and lift efficiency in the environment with gravity, which made it unsuitable to be pushed into mass production. Only the original small prototype was kept and modified by the Science Council into a specialized CUB with high-speed assault ability and strong firepower which can move freely after firing a shot.	1000032
47	16120000	2	2	No.002	Shimmer's coating is extremely sound-proof and wave-proof, allowing it to fly at a high speed and approach the enemy almost without being noticed. It loves to creep on people and scare them out of a sudden. However, whenever it tries to play the same trick on Bianca, it will always be caught red-handed and touched gently by her, which of course doesn't stop it from doing this for it has already become a secret game between them.	1000033
48	16120000	3	2	No.003	At first, Bianca thought the CUB would increase the chance of being exposed in the mission, after all, as a member of the Purifying Force, she always needs to sneak into somewhere alone. But during her last meeting with Chiko, the Vice-Captain of the Purifying Force, Chiko wanted her to accept the council's advice. Maybe it was because of Chiko's suggestion. Maybe she had some kind of hunch long ago... Shimmer was eventually produced. It has become Bianca's exclusive CUB companion after she switched to Stigmata.	1000034
49	16120000	1	1	Background I	Although it looks a bit intimidating in its extended form, Shimmer is actually very lively and gentle before its owner. Its mood is shown clearly on its display panel.	
50	16120000	2	1	Background II	The project owner in charge of the development of CUB Shimmer would like to remind every user to keep it busy, otherwise, they might suffer from unwanted loss of property and personal injury, and the developers will not be held responsible if any of the abovementioned situations appends.	
51	16130000	1	2	No.001	Punchy was originally an auxiliary machine used by Lee of Gray Raven to collect the combat data for his new frame. The Science Council later modified it into a Combat Unit Booster that could link to Constructs, and added more nanomachine parts for combat.	1000035
52	16130000	2	2	No.002	"No one would have thought that Punchy was once a smart desktop companion that could be bought in any gift shop during the Golden Age.\nIts parts have been replaced numerous times, but there is one part that has never been swapped out. Even though it no longer serves as the core drive, it still fits perfectly in Punchy and has become its ""soul."""	1000036
53	16130000	3	2	No.003	I recently found something: When connected, Punchy's screen will display irregular emotes. The root cause is yet to be identified, but given this has no clear impact on the collection of combat data, no repairs have been planned.\nUpdate: I figured it out! It will synchronize with the emotions of the Constructs that link to it, and show them in these emotes!\nUpdate: The emotion synchronization does not seem to apply on Lee. He always has a poker face when Punchy's screen is rapidly changing... I'll just keep the record here. Attachment: Below are the emotes of Punchy during a joint operation between Gray Raven and Strike Hawk: ( ｀д′) [twice] (ー`′ー) [twice] (?_?) [3 times] (/////) [once] ╰(*°▽°*)╯ [once]\n—An abstract from the personal diary of a Science Council technician.	1000037
54	16130000	1	1	Background I	Punchy's calm, quiet characteristics often give others a misunderstanding that it is not equipped with an autonomous emotion simulation system. It always watches everything around itself in silence.	
55	16130000	2	1	Background II	The designer has not put an absolute limit on Punchy's transformation mechanism while it is on standby, so don't be shocked when you see a fist next to you. Maybe it only wants to give you a thumbs-up, or a cup of coffee.	
56	16140000	1	2	No.001	Originally a robotic artistic education assistant at the Center of Basic Public Education, Rainbow is equipped with 127 pigments, 28 types of paintbrushes, and 7 types of paint sprayers. After being modified into a Combat Unit Booster by Leonie, Rainbow is able to sweep the battlefield with splashes of color alongside Kaleido's Beam Gunlance.	1000038
57	16140000	2	2	No.002	Rainbow's bowknot was a gift from the kids at the Center of Basic Public Education when it left there, now its most treasured ornament that it refuses to take off even on the battlefield. However kind and pleasant Rainbow is, if any enemy dares dirty its bowknot, it will end battles like a devastating hurricane.	1000039
58	16140000	3	2	No.003	"Presumably affected by its owner, among all the CUBs Rainbow is the one most into ""making friends."" To the staff of the Science Council, it is common to see Rainbow building bridges with other CUBs in the maintenance room. And one day, when the staff of the Science Council returned to the maintenance room after a vacation, they immediately realized that they had forgotten to enable hibernate mode on the CUBs before they left. The maintenance room was turned into a ""party room"" with every inch splashed with colors by Rainbow. All the CUBs were so high that they were parading around the room, celebrating. This merrymaking lasted until the Science Council called in the CUBs' owners to calm them down."	1000040
59	16140000	1	1	Background I	In most cases, Rainbow is delightful and enjoys jokes and pranks, but you should never take this for granted. Once it feels you have gone too far, it will squirt a shower of special pigment that will not come off for a whole month.	
60	16140000	2	1	Background II	As Rainbow is a CUB inspired by a marine species like Shimmer and Seeshell, it makes the three of them become a close trio of friends among all CUBs. Rainbow would give Shimmer a new coating once in a while and relax lying on Seeshell in leisure time.	
61	16150000	1	2	No.001	Motorbolt was originally Alpha's motorcycle, yet she couldn't always keep it by her side due to the challenges posed by diverse terrains. To make her rides more convenient, Alpha continually modified Motorbolt. After adding some combat modules, Alpha managed to reduce it to the current portable mechanical form. As for this design… perhaps it was inspired by some offhand suggestions from Luna?	1000041
62	16150000	2	2	No.002	Motorbolt's compact form is equipped with a powerful turbocharged engine and stealth radar technology, coupled with enhanced communication channels. These features ensure maximum stealth and safety for its rider on the surface. However, with that powerful engine comes louder noise levels. Despite Alpha equipping it with the best available air filters and mufflers, Motorbolt was taken aback by its own roar during its initial run.	1000042
63	16150000	3	2	No.003	Motorbolt doesn't seem too pleased with its compact form. Instead, it prefers its original form and often gives Alpha high-speed joyrides during downtimes. The fiery-red bike, carrying its master, blazes across the wastelands like a bolt of crimson lightning. Fortunately, Alpha has no qualms about this little indulgence.	1000043
64	16150000	1	1	Background I	Motorbolt doesn't like to use its speaker system much, but it's got a temperament as fiery as its engine. Don't test its patience, ever.	
65	16150000	2	1	Background II	"After transformation, the jagged parts at the front aren't Motorbolt's ""mouth."" But unless necessary, never place your hand near those jagged parts unsupervised. Or you'll regret it."	
66	16160000	1	2	No.001	Originally serving as a police mechanoid beast within Babylonia, Hades Fangs' dire look and swift mobility were designed to suppress criminals. Kurono researchers gave it further modifications—particularly on its offensive power—to make it a Combat Unit Booster (CUB) that could fight along Constructs.	1000044
67	16160000	2	2	No.002	"According to reports submitted by researchers, the adaptation process for Hades Fangs was rather ""primitive"" compared to other CUBs. It seems to classify people into only three categories: ""master"" (those it cannot defeat), ""servants"" (those it can overpower), and middle-aged researchers who will comply with all its requests once it intimidates them."	1000045
68	16160000	3	2	No.003	"During the initial design phase, there were several proposals to modify Hades Fangs' appearance, which could be roughly categorized as ""adorable pet,"" ""fierce beast,"" as well as ""Cerberus"", which was proposed by the user herself. After the ""Cerberus"" proposal was unanimously voted against, supporters of the remaining two proposals began a lengthy debate until recordings of Hades Fangs' battle from the Hetero Zone were sent back. ""Let's go with this one."" —Vesalius made the final decision after browsing through the clips."	1000046
69	16160000	1	1	Background I	Always likes to jump out of a dark corner to scare those it likes. If the attempt is unsuccessful, it would keep trying until it succeeds.	
70	16160000	2	1	Background II	Hades Fangs is always obsessed with challenging other CUBs in various competitions, for example, racing with Frost Oath or wrestling with Yuan Ye. But its favorite activity is the daily battle with Jet Jaeger. Researchers have to separate them to avoid non-combat-related damages.	
71	16170000	1	2	No.001	Originally a backup frame produced as a prototype in the M.I.N.D. fusion experiment, the concept of Dawn Chorus had drawn reference from Babylonia CUBs, in which several Dawn Choruses were supposed to assist the M.I.N.D. fusion test subject for high-precision joint combat.	1000047
72	16170000	2	2	No.002	To handle most combat situations, Dawn Chorus is equipped with four legs and wings, enabling it to perform decently both in the air and on land. While some have also raised concerns that its large size might hinder stealth operations, the chief developer believes that when the situation really needs Dawn Chorus, stealth operation is probably no longer an option.	1000048
73	16170000	3	2	No.003	"While Dawn Chorus was created as a weapon of violence, it demonstrated great restraint in exerting its power. This confused the Utopia scientists who developed it, leading them to suspect that the M.I.N.D. fusion technology had flaws. In fact, Dawn Chorus has its own judgment criteria—it will fight to protect the ""weak,"" and only use its full strength against opponents that it regards as ""evil."" ""It seems to possess noble virtues like a knight,"" commented Echo, who fought alongside Dawn Chorus."	1000049
74	16170000	1	1	Background I	Really hates getting dirty. Will actively seek out clean water sources to wash itself clean even if there is a tiny mark on its white armor.	
75	16170000	2	1	Background II	When excited, it will impulsively attempt to screech. However, as Dawn Chorus is not equipped with a voice module, it always appears to be rather depressed after failing to vocalize. Perhaps we should try to give it a voice module?	
76	16180000	1	2	No.001	Originally a bionic machine customized by a marine animal research center in the Golden Age for in-depth study of dolphin behaviors, Cetus was accidentally left forgotten in the sea due to changes in the center's staffing and project funding.	1000050
77	16180000	2	2	No.002	Cetus was not equipped with many weapons, as it was originally intended for scientific research purposes. In contrast, it had outstanding emotion simulating programs, which, in some aspects, were too good—some researchers at that time often had the false impression that Cetus really developed emotions.	1000051
78	16180000	3	2	No.003	As time went by, Cetus' peers had all vanished, leaving behind only Cetus with an aging and damaged body. It was calmly awaiting its ending when its sensors detected Lamia. Cetus' memory shell and emotion simulating programs were unable to understand the modifications it underwent, but the result is evident: it can now roam the ocean in a completely new form. Right now, it only wants to stay with Lamia though.	1000052
79	16180000	1	1	Background I	Enjoys floating belly-up on the sea surface to bask in the sun. Sometimes, the ocean current would take Cetus across an incredibly long distance after it has been sun bathing for too long, and it takes a lot of effort for it to swim back.	
80	16180000	2	1	Background II	Cetus greatly enjoyed pointing ships in the direction of the coast, but such opportunities are now very rare, which often gives it depression. It resorted to sunbathing to handle this problem until it recently discovered some human vessels could possibly still exist in high latitude regions.	
81	16190000	1	2	No.001	Created based on an indoor close-quarters combat support attacking machine, it was originally designed to be a mass-produced solo wingman. Due to the manufacturing difficulty and poor budget control, it was modified into a specialized CUB.	1000053
82	16190000	2	2	No.002	It used to be a headache for the researchers and designers to make an indoor weapon to a wide-range CUB. Thankfully, the timely application of new energy system fundamentally solved Shadow Wing's endurance problem. Besides, the AI module update has boosted its auto battle performance.	1000054
83	16190000	3	2	No.003	Shadow Wing's co-op module has been improved several times based on the best data obtained from multiple practices with Watanabe. Watanabe's hook missed Shadow Wing several times and failed to connect to it. And there were times when the two failed to work with each other due to poor light at night. Now with the adjustments to their night vision equipment and the new material of Shadow Wing's hook attachment, their connection won't break easily even in the worst conditions.	1000055
84	16190000	1	1	Background I	Shadow Wing looks inactive by standing on Watanabe's shoulder with its wings folded. But don't be fooled by it. It is actually on the lookout for anyone suspicious getting close to Watanabe.	
85	16190000	2	1	Background II	Shadow Wing does not always patrol at night. It also patrols during the day. Though looked scary, Shadow Wing is actually a CUB that fears strangers. It always flies in the least noticeable way and mimics the surroundings to hide, making it hard to be noticed.	
86	16200000	1	2	No.001	To make Huiyu more versatile and enhance its efficiency, the Kowloong Crew have modified it into a CUB, significantly upgrading its combat abilities and intelligence.	1000056
87	16200000	2	2	No.002	Since Huiyu already possesses decent combat capabilities, the modifications focus more on enhancing its durability and providing more diverse attack methods, such as more reliable flying capabilities and ranged attacks.	1000057
88	16200000	3	2	No.003	The frame itself has special significance, so we decided not to give the structure a major overhaul during the upgrade. However, that decision had set us back in various ways. When approached, it would become extremely aggressive, forcing us to put the upgrade on hold. Fortunately, Lady Qu came soon after to oversee the modifications so we could complete the work on time. As for the wing upgrades... That's another story. —A Fuxi Crew member currently on medical leave	1000058
89	16200000	1	1	Background I	After the modification was completed, Qu gave Huiyu more free time to venture around. The newly added positioning system ensures that it no longer gets lost.	
90	16200000	2	1	Background II	"Huiyu is extremely alert to human-shaped objects, with the exception of Qu and a particular Babylonia commandant. After gaining the ability to perform ranged attacks, it would even shoot its ""plumes"" at any stranger that approaches without permission.

92	16210000	2	2	No.002	After the outbreak, the staff put Guardrake in hibernation and placed it deep underground, hoping to awaken it once the park reopened. However, the park was gradually forgotten over time. Guardrake finally woke again due to a programming error. Although the world looked nothing like the data in its memories, it continued its daily routine—spreading its wings and patrolling the silent, abandoned park.	1000060
93	16210000	3	2	No.003	After years of solitude, a girl finally set foot in Guardrake's desolate kingdom. It flew over her and landed before her. Guardrake's movements were jerky due to damaged components and insufficient energy, but it still maintained the proud poise of a guardian. No one knows what happened exactly, but after their encounter, Guardrake left its little domain and embarked on a new journey at the side of its newfound mistress with a completely new look.	1000061
94	16210000	1	1	Background I	Guardrake cherishes every item given to it by Luna and never allows anyone to touch them without explicit permission.	
95	16210000	2	1	Background II	Though its appearance may seem fearsome and volatile, Guardrake is actually calm and composed, rarely losing its temper. It is also unexpectedly skillful in dealing with children as it has spent many years in a fairytale amusement park.	
96	16220000	1	2	ID 001	Like its owner, Dreamwing is gentle and kind most of the time when there's no battle. It will stay on your shoulder and flap its wings to show you its friendliness. It will deliberately bring some dust to you and shake it off on you if it finds you unfriendly.	1000062
97	16220000	2	2	ID 002	Dreamwing once envied bird frames with big wings, thinking that if it had larger wings, it could deal massive Physical DMG with a slight flap of wings. It stopped thinking about it after its owner said the wings it has are cuter.	1000063
98	16220000	3	2	ID 003	Dreamwing is satisfied with the dark edge of its wings for the color matches its owner's frame and allows it to hide in shadows and launch a surprise strike at the enemy. However, it could also be ignored by others when trying to get close to them and feel sad secretly in the corner.	1000064
99	16220000	1	1	Background I	Dreamwing insists on keeping its moves perfect and elegant in battle. It treats flying as a serious form of art and dances based on her own understanding of dancing. Once called a dance enthusiast CUB, it usually flies around its owner while she's practicing dancing.	
100	16220000	2	1	Background II	Dreamwing is sometimes childish. It loves to hang out with Pulao and comes back with dirt all over to ask its owner to clean it up.

It stayed by his side even after he fell asleep and was still there when he woke up."""	1000066
103	16230000	3	2	ID 003	According to research data, Snowveil's design was well received at the Youth Center. The children loved its playful and lively demeanor and were happy to interact with it. However, it should be noted that due to the underlying logic, Snowveil cannot actively decline unnecessary interactions. Excess interaction may lead to system overload, resulting in it not being able to respond to real needs in time. This phenomenon was alleviated when Wanshi performed Adaptation Fitting with it. Now, Snowveil has learned how to avoid social interactions and knows all the best spots to take a break. Sometimes, you may even catch it resting together with Wanshi. This change in behavior has allowed it to store up energy to help those who are truly in need in a more timely manner and provide even more support.	1000067
104	16230000	1	1	Background I	Snowveil has a quiet nature and rarely appears in front of the public. However, its lithe and pure white image has burrowed itself into people's hearts. It is considered lucky to spot Snowveil in the wild.	
105	16230000	2	1	Background II	"Amongst the numerous ways to attract Snowveil, the most effective way is to pile up small parts in its area of activity. The Combat Unit Booster maintenance staff always tells new interns the following, ""See? It'll come running out to lie on top of the pile and dig with its little paws. But remember, this is your best chance to do your observation records. Never get too close because it's really sensitive and will run off. Also, it really hurts if you get hit by its tail."""

After a mission, those who helped Corvus reported receiving rewards in return: sometimes it would bring them sparkling objects, or appear just when help was needed. Its handlers continued to track the reports and discovered that even outside the battlefield, Corvus would return the favor to those who had helped it. The technicians referred to this behavior as the ""reciprocity mechanism""."	1000070

They suggest swapping in better or more compatible materials for stability. But the designer explains that Scaled Rampart's true strength lies in how it adapts and repairs itself in messy battle conditions. Its materials work well together and are easy to replace, which helps it last longer on the field.	1000097

155	16330000	2	1	Background II	"Its maintenance reports had long included bits of unidentified cached data, which most engineers assumed were just leftover clutter from its complicated control system. It wasn't until a later self-check that Veronica finally discovered the truth: those mysterious files were actually a bunch of dry, deadpan jokes generated by Scaled Rampart. This time, she didn't get mad. Instead, Scaled Rampart was given a dedicated space to store its jokes.

159	16340000	1	1	Background I	Don't be fooled by Levvi's harmless look. Beneath that cute exterior lies serious firepower. Its design was inspired by a legendary creature from human myths—one said to command the forces of nature with ease. What the engineers didn't expect was how much Levvi would also act like its mythical muse.
