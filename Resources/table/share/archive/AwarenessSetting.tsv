To others, the death of this genius puzzle-solver itself was an impenetrable mystery. The World Government blocked all the information regarding his death. Over the years, two relatively reasonable speculations emerged. The first suggests that Turing's experiments had in fact achieved more than satisfactory results, but he refused to submit them for his own consideration or other ""ethical"" reasons, leading to his ""disposal."" The second is that Turing's death itself was a well-designed ""experiment."" In order to explore the future of computer AI and human intelligence, this genius chose to use himself as the subject. Regardless of the true cause, even in his demise, Turing's memory data continues to influence the cutting-edge research in relevant fields."	811006

This is a covenant that I cannot violate.'\nWe stayed with her, watching her calmly and gladly drink that cup of wine. She then lay cleanly on the table, holding her favorite staff that looked like a sword in her arms. The ink on the tablet next to her hand had not even dried.\n'Let's go.'\nThose were her final words. The executioner saw her eyes fixed, and her heart grew cold and stiff. He closed her mouth, shut her eyes, and covered her with a spotless white cloth.\nJust like that, the most virtuous and upright person—I swear—of all the people we have known in this era, died without a sound, not even leaving a whisper of lamentation.""\n—A follower of Signa"	811006

There was never an empty seat at his operations. Liston never faltered when faced with tough decisions. He never hesitated to amputate patients in dire situations and subsequently performed mechanical modifications on them. He remained unfazed in the face of ethical criticism from the public. ""Being soft sows the seeds of future complications. Removal should be performed at the first signs of corruption.

To challenge this ""scientific gospel,"" she boldly criticized the trend and wrote ""The Song of Nature"", later known as the ""General Principles of Natural Philosophy"". In this poetic work, she described the universe as a ""living fire"", criticizing the worship of science. Over time, ethical organizations often cited her work, making it a foundation for regulating scientific experiments. Few people knew that the young philosopher cared little for her fame.

After all, no philosopher could resist the temptation to glimpse the true nature of the universe. Perhaps the first great flame that forged the cosmos lay hidden beneath the veil of quantum fluctuations. At the flame-lighting ceremony of the first Zero-Point Energy Reactor, Heraclitus stood alone in a quiet corner, watching as the towering steel beast—once a symbol of civilization's hope—erupted in crimson flames. The fire, named The Punishing, crashed down upon the earth like divine wrath. As the Golden Age met its end, shock and fear froze everyone's faces. Only the Weeping Philosopher smiled gently, raising her arms to embrace the creation fire she had long yearned for. ""If humans steal the divine fire and become our own Prometheus, we shall pay the price by being bound on Mount Caucasus, forever sharing the endless agony of the eternal flame."" —The Song of Nature"	811006
164511	1645	1	2	Story I	"""If time before the Golden Age was a long night before dawn, then Wilde was the first ray of twilight that tore through the darkness."" Wilde, active at the end of the Golden Age, is regarded by the WGAA as one of the most influential literary figures. Her works, known for both their artistry and accessibility, focused on the theme of ""love"" and were beloved by people everywhere. Many of her fairy tales are still considered classics by critics. She rejected the orthodox and advocated for spontaneous creation through pure talent and intuition. ""Of course, narcissism is the beginning of a lifelong romance. If I don't love myself, how can I love the world?"" With her sharp pen, the romantic poet called for embracing universal love, but ended up being prosecuted by. She was accused of ""inciting immoral behavior"" and exiled. Yet, she continued to live by her ideals, urging people to love fearlessly. It wasn't until the publication of ""The New Earth Book"" that she regained her freedom to return home. ""A philosopher once said: Art is the imitation of nature. However, before humans gave meaning to beauty, nature was not seen as a thing of beauty. Therefore, nature is the imitation of art, and it is we who have created this beautiful world!"""	811003
164512	1645	2	2	Story II	"Wilde fell in love with travel during her years of exile. Many had seen Wilde, dressed in fine clothes, gazing at the stars, lost in a rainbow of inspiration in the scorching sands of North Africa or the barren tundra of the Arctic. Countless artists followed in Wilde's creative footsteps, and it was no exaggeration to say she was like the rose of the Muses: wherever she stepped, a sea of artistic flowers bloomed. The World Government regarded Wilde as a pioneer of new literature and invited her to join their unification efforts. However, as borders were gradually abolished, Wilde was free to roam, making it increasingly difficult to track her down. Finding this elusive writer became the biggest challenge for all. Many years later, people found the late poet in the ruins of a prison. She sat quietly on the worn marble steps, a red-feathered quill resting beside her, as if she wished to leave her final note on the world before parting. Years of exile had ravaged Wilde's body, yet there was not a trace of bitterness in her writings. Even in the final moments of her life, Wilde continued to declare her love for the world: ""My love, do not mourn the fallen petals. I have left my soul for the world. Love boldly, for we shall one day embrace under the heaven of spirits!"""	811006
164611	1646	1	2	Story I	"Mathematician, physicist, pioneer of modern biomechanics... As a genius of the Golden Age, Herschell's every step was followed with eager attention, even giving rise to a school of Machina named after her. Yet, she cared little for public admiration, always focusing on her next design. ""I prefer my identity as a mechanical engineer over those titles."" Herschell's classes were always packed, as she skillfully showcased the vibrant and interesting side of Machina to her students in a romantic style, often bringing in ordinary or what could be deemed ""trivial"" toys. Tools like steam-powered balls, steam organs, and vending machines—crafted during her leisure time—were incorporated into her work, ""Mechanics and Optics,"" as she believed that the answers to the next revolution might be hidden within these primitive designs. Even in an age of electronic information, she still preferred to use paper materials to record her flights of fancy, and some of her works even look like unfinished classroom notes. Do not question, this is the ""Herschell style""—her students explained, pointing to a chubby flying dragon drawn on the scattered drafts as they organized them."	811003
164612	1646	2	2	Story II	"Where will machines and humans go from here? Herschell has imagined many futures, but no matter how many speculations she has, she firmly believes one thing will never change: ""Love begets love, and in the future, there will be mechanoids that deeply love humans."" This is also the principle she has always upheld when creating machines. But before machines and humans could take their next step, the Punishing Virus hit. Disaster struck, and people fled from the mechanoids around them. Only Herschell chose to go against the tide. All the students will remember that day: the mechanical dragon born of love and imagination soared into the sky, flying without hesitation towards the direction Herschell pointed, like a new star tearing through the darkness, dispelling the approaching crisis. Under this protection, Herschell watched her students evacuate and then walked side by side with the mechanoids. Her departing footsteps never wavered, just as she believed this moment was not the end of the coexistence of machines and humans. Many years later, during a search operation, people reentered the campus and were drawn to the brilliant Memory samples and her final manuscript. Amidst the harmonious melody of a steam organ, someone opened the manuscript and read the first sentence: ""The Punishing Virus is not the end of harmonious coexistence between machines and humans, because there are machines that give love to humans in return—can you hear the echo of these words?"""	811006
164711	1647	1	2	Story I	A linguist named Randolph disappeared without a trace, leaving no ripple in this world. She had no close friends, nor did she keep any ties with her family. The only time the world could reach her was during her attendance at select academic forums. It is said that her last appearance was at an observatory, where she spent a week with an astronomer who would soon die of cancer. She also once sent a letter under the name Sothoth, which she referred to as herself thereafter. Noticing that the street listed on the envelope no longer existed, I requested a check on the letter. In it, she claimed to have glimpsed another world, a world where two elliptical suns hung, housing stretched toward an endless horizon, and a sky was evenly partitioned with stars flickering wondrously through the rifts. And a beautiful-sounding language could be heard, so gorgeous that it made her realize her smallness as a linguist... I suspected this might be a delusional disorder stemming from mental illness, scientifically speaking. Nevertheless, Randolph's birdcages at home were found scattered with feathers from unidentifiable species... —Notes of an investigator from the Golden Age.	811003
164712	1647	2	2	Story II	"Sothoth affirmed that she had at least once reached a truth beyond anyone's comprehension, though her claim remained unacknowledged. Every time she opened that silver birdcage the majestic city would unfold before her eyes. Yet, any attempt to step beyond her role as an observer would leave her awakening in a haze on her bed. Believing that language was the vessel of civilization, she decided to seek out the language within. At last, she deciphered the meaning behind the characters engraved on the silver birdcage—the gate. ""I've been standing before a gate that I can't open. I can only glimpse through tiny cracks..."" A voice calling to her, accompanied by a thousand eyes locking onto hers. Wings of the abyss gradually sprouted from her back, pulling her away from the world she once belonged to. ""Gravestones hold no more meaning for me. The past, present, and future... An ocean of information flooding into my mind, guiding me to this realm of knowledge."" Crimson waves surged forth as the gate swung open. Faced with countless versions of herself and paths leading to three different futures, she was so captivated that she forgot to cross back through the gate before it shut. ""Only I and my own self linger before the Gateway."" Upon which, a nearly eternal silence descended, until a figure appeared with a key as tall as itself to open the gate again. At that moment, this consciousness data materialized in Babylonia's database out of nowhere."	811006

Where Barcelo grew up was full of such danger and chaos. The only thing she could trust was the gun in her hand. Barcelo is a renowned genius shooter, starting from the moment she pulled the trigger for the first time at twelve. The bullet shatters the micro core of the haywire mechanoid with extreme precision, forcing it to stop from killing. The moment she aimed was so attractive, and the sound of the bullet coming out was so pleasant. Her parents arrived later and held her in their arms without knowing that she wasn't shivering due to fear but the thrill it gave her. During the following ten-plus years of her life, she wandered freely in the sinful wilderness like a ghost traveling the world on a wild horse, ending numerous criminals' lives with the burning flames coming out of her luxury revolver. Enemies called her the ""nightmare revolver."" The ""light"" of the law reached this wilderness while she was traveling around to eliminate criminals. However, it didn't bring security as expected.

She saw people screaming and running, more scared than any criminal she had seen. The ""Punishing Virus"". That's how they called it. She learned this from a dying prison guard. She was free again at the moment when the revolver was back in her hand. No shooters understand mechanoid structure better than her. She knows where the control unit is and where the energy core is. With her knowledge and her bullets, even the strongest enemy would be penetrated by her bullet. Her soul shivered for joy just like it did when she was twelve. Bang, bang, bang... She infused her life into the chamber, breaking out a way out through the sea of mechanoids.

165011	1650	1	2	Story I	"Klenova was born in an ordinary arctic village in the year when the Arctic Route Union's fleet entered their port. Years later, in the ship's whistle and under the gaze of her grandparents, Klenova and her parents left this small fishing village where they were born and raised for a more prosperous, bigger city following the tide of the times. Klenova didn't know if this change is good or not, but she knew it was time for her to march forward. To carve out a place for herself, she studied in a medical university and became a nurse intern, following the soldiers to the battlefields. That was when she heard about a dangerous rumor for the first time. It's said that in a shadowy corner of the Arctic, an economic organization is mass-producing mechanoid creatures and that they have already manufactured mechanoid narwhals that look just like the real ones. Klenova didn't take it seriously when she heard it. ""Why would anyone spend so much money on something so meaningless?"" was her response. Little did she know that the rumor would become a lifelong torment for her."	811003

However, Klenova refused to give up. To find the ""answer,"" she walked on that snowfield every day, burying herself in papers. Test tubes and reports were scattered across the lab. But all her efforts were in vain. There were no miracles. Her job stopped one day when she detected an infected mechanoid narwhal swimming to the station. And her hometown, the little fishing village, was not far behind the station. Her boss urged her to leave immediately with all the experiment reports, but she couldn't convince herself of leaving behind the hundreds of elders in the village. She hesitated a bit but eventually picked up a simple mechanoid signal jammer and sailed out of the harbor on a small yacht. This time, there was no one to see her off."	811006
165111	1651	1	2	Story I	"""Stay away from all swords."" This was the ancestral precept Hervor heard from her family when she first began to form memories—the last words of a great knight in her lineage, who became entangled in power struggles due to his loyalty, and whose sword ultimately failed to protect him. But Hervor never cared; swordsmanship became her greatest passion. Though disapproved by her illustrious family, she persistently followed her own path. People frequently witnessed her riding out from the family estate into the forest, where she would practice swordplay for entire days. ""Don't address me as 'Lady' Hervor—it's 'Dame' Hervor,"" she most often declared. Yet the opulent family mansion was never a sanctuary she wished to inhabit long. On her coming-of-age day, she boarded a vessel of the family fleet and sailed toward the unknown. Her courage guided the fleet through storms to reach one unprecedented wonder after another. During an unparalleled tempest, the fleet was driven toward perilous cliffs where an eerie greatsword stood embedded in the black rock. The sailors, having never witnessed such a sight, exchanged uneasy glances, none daring to approach for fear of a sea curse. Undaunted, Hervor strode forward. As she advanced, the howling storm grew fiercer, mingling with the wind's shriek across the cliffs—sounds that seemed to form a voice from the sword itself, calling her name. She reached out and drew the blade."	811003
165112	1651	2	2	Story II	"As the flames of the World Unification War spread, Hervor appeared at a government army recruitment center. The recruiting officer eyed the greatsword at her side skeptically, questioning her suitability as a government soldier: ""We've no need for knights playing at swordsmanship here; the battlefield demands marksmen and technicians."" Yet by that evening, tales of Hervor had spread throughout the new camp, growing increasingly fantastical—rumors claimed an unassuming recruit, when provoked by superiors, had swept through the recruitment office with her greatsword and instantly secured elite recruit status. With time, the war's smoke engulfed more lands, and the girl named Hervor gradually became a battlefield legend. She never feared, never retreated, cleaving through every obstacle with her greatsword. Her name featured on nearly every commendation list following victorious campaigns. They said she fought like a knight—this era's last knight. But ultimately, the legend was consumed by smoke. Fearing the ""Knight's"" reputation, enemy forces avoided confronting her directly. They fabricated an urgent civilian distress signal, luring Hervor into an empty building rigged with explosives. Amidst those ruins, everything turned to ash—save for a greatsword radiating an unprecedented light, as if her resolve remained utterly unshaken. Hervor's comrades entrusted this sword to Babylonia, sincerely wishing her spirit might continue to shine on the battlefield as it always had—even if only as a Tactical Memory Chip. ""Did she die a warrior?"" — This was the family's sole question after hearing the messenger's report of Hervor's death. ""No. All say she died a true knight... a true hero."" — The messenger answered truthfully."	811006
165211	1652	1	2	Story I	"Jeanne came from an ordinary rural village in Western Europe. Legend had it that when she was young, she heard a ""divine voice"" that had warned humanity to pump the brakes on technological advancement to avoid ""divine retribution."" But in the Golden Age of prosperity brought about by technology, almost no one took a little girl's word for it. During the winter of Jeanne's seventeenth year, the Punishing Virus exploded in full force from a Zero-point energy overflow. Its fierce aggression struck terror into government officials, who threw objective strategic conditions out the window and blindly executed retreats, leaving millions stranded and surrounded by Corrupted in Valley City No. 181. Upon learning of this crisis, Jeanne claimed to have received divine will and insisted on advancing from her remote, peaceful village to the front lines. After the city's defender had repeatedly failed to hold position and received no response to pleas for reinforcement, he chose in utter desperation to hand command over to this girl who had ""received divine revelation."" Jeanne completely flipped the script on the previous conservative strategy. She seized the opportunity while most Corrupted were besieging City No. 181 to risk leading troops to restart the abandoned Central Purification Filters in the surrounding area, thereby weakening the Corrupted's battle power. She then used the valley terrain to scatter and eliminate the Corrupted forces, successfully breaking the siege after more than ten days of continuous combat. This counter-siege battle not only turned the tide for millions within the city but also became one of the few victorious campaign milestones for humanity following the Punishing Virus outbreak. Jeanne thus became a true ""Holy Maiden"" in every sense of the word."	811003
165212	1652	2	2	Story II	"After her great victory, Jeanne keeps moving between battlefields, but she tragically perishes three years later in a medium-scale engagement. The city gates, meant to provide retreat for frontline soldiers, are sealed prematurely by the commanding officer, who cites the imminent Punishing Virus Corruption of the city as justification. As part of the rear guard withdrawal, Jeanne is forced to fight the Corrupted to the death outside the city walls. Yet, even while standing at the center of the battlefield, she still orders the defending soldiers to activate the sentinel cannons for defense as planned. The city is spared thanks to the timely activation of the sentinel cannons, but Jeanne herself dies in the artillery fire. When people find her, her body is severely burned, yet she maintains a prayer pose even in her final moments. Wherever she goes, the banner she carries is so vivid that her followers fervently believe that fighting for her, dying for her, is equivalent to fighting for God, dying for God. Even so, the heavy casualties among the soldiers she leads remain an undeniable fact. In this age of scientific supremacy, many harbor doubts about the ""miracles"" Jeanne claimed to witness, questioning the victories she achieved—could such feats truly be accomplished by a girl not yet twenty years old? Legends surrounding Jeanne remain diverse and controversial, with endless debate. However, people universally acknowledge her courageous action in stepping forward when all others had lost hope. Whether or not she truly heard the divine voice, her deeds greatly bolster humanity's confidence in fighting back against the Punishing Virus. What she embodies is precisely what still shines within human nature even after the Golden Age's Glory has faded—the radiance known as ""courage."""	811006

165311	1653	1	2	Story I	"At the end of the Golden Age, a nightingale took flight from an apothecary's herb-scented chamber. This was Keats: once an apprentice apothecary, then a medical student at King's Academy, standing just a door away from a dignified hall of glory. Yet, when choosing between a respectable standing and a humble dream, she picked up her quill. Her life then became one of ink and wine, of loved ones dying young, of tuberculosis' slow torment and poverty's relentless grip. It was an era of upheaval—a time when political strife invaded literature with fierce aggression, and rigid doctrines crowded out romantic thought. The world forged itself into a thundering mechanical beast, all turning gears and smokestacks breathing persistent dark clouds. Amidst a reality choked with anxiety, illness, and unrest, Keats planted beech trees and wild roses in her verse; nightingales still sang in the dappled shadows of her green leaves. But critics dismissed the tender perspective in her gentle poetry. They scorned her humble origins and so-called crude insights, dismissing her voice as lower-class chatter. Even as the mainstream stripped away her right to describe the world, Keats answered with more powerful strokes, with fuller emotion, with the nightingale's defiant song. Slander became her finest praise. The first word that flashed in her mind became her rhyme; the vibrant life of nature seeded her imagery. Creation was, for her, a pure journey of imagination—unbound by beginning or end, a natural flow of bright emotion. ""When I grow a bit more mature, I want to use poetry to do some good for the world."" She would turn verse into a distinctive medicine to defy despair, leading the way toward a more emotional, more free new era. Facing the future with hope, she never surrendered to malice, offering her promise to the world like a newborn dawn."	811003
165312	1653	2	2	Story II	"""This is arterial blood. I'm a medical student. I know I'm going to die."" The warm, humid air of the southern lands could no longer sustain Keats' ailing body. A half-lifetime of medical knowledge had taught her only how to prophesy her own end. That dawn-bright promise, once brimming with vitality, had proven to be a fleeting dream, lasting less than two years. Death arrived as fate's gentle sigh—the slightest ripple stirring the lake's surface before stillness returns. Her final curtain fell as hastily as her brief passage through the world. Would anyone remember her? Would the genuine emotion woven into her verses endure? Likely, it would all fade like blossoms on a stream, beautiful and transient. Confronting the world's relentless change, Keats' only defiance was to meet it with tenderness. She said: Here lies one whose name was writ in water. Centuries later, Keats opened her eyes as a Memory. From fragmented records, she learned of the stone monument erected beside her grave. Across the vast gulf of time, here was the world's answer: Keats, if your exalted name was written in water, then every drop is a tear upon a mourner's cheek. A researcher regretfully informed her that Babylonia held no certainty that the monument had survived the calamity. It seemed that even as a Memory, her luck had not changed. ""It doesn't matter,"" she said with a soft smile. The poet, her eyes veiled in white silk, had been stripped of the right to gaze upon the world or speak of it directly. Yet true imaginative freedom exists beyond mere reality; poetry is reason's wings. ""That fresh flowers will grow, and many glories of immortal stamp."" To dwell forever in unease and doubt, yet to forever forge truth and beauty from that very suffering—this, too, remained quintessentially Keats."	811006

165411	1654	1	2	Story I	Not everyone is destined to be a hero, and the world has few legends worth singing. Before the Punishing Virus outbreak, Natasha was born into nobility. Her lineage and beauty paved her way, while her wit helped her navigate the intricacies of human relationships. Yet, she was still only sixteen, a girl who had not yet grasped the meaning of life or chosen her path. When the Punishing Virus erupted. In that calamity, everything she knew was shattered in an instant. When she regained awareness, the belongings she had brought from home lay scattered around her, alongside the guards who had died protecting her. She didn't even know how to react. And so, Natasha lost consciousness.	811003
165412	1654	2	2	Story II	"Luckily, Natasha was rescued and taken to a refugee camp. No one there recognized her former status, and unlike other nobles, she never demanded special treatment. After several relocations, she became a laborer in the camp, using her education to produce simple supplies and mimicking the ways of former servants to welcome returning soldiers. She once applied to become a Construct, but her body did not meet the requirements. She once hoped her etiquette and upbringing would secure her a role as a logistics clerk, but the military's standards were far stricter than she had imagined. She once dreamed of using her intellect to join the fight as a scholar, but beside true researchers, her mind was but a flickering, insignificant firefly. So, she returned to the camp once again, to labor day after day, year after year. Later, Natasha likely fell ill and passed away. When officials reviewed refugee registries from various fronts, her name often stood out. She had not retreated with the army, but instead found ways to move closer to the front lines, continuing her work. When they traced her to the last recorded camp, they found Natasha had remained there forever. A simple grave, marked by a tombstone of small stones and fabric strips, bore her epitaph: ""I am Natasha. I lived."""	811006
165511	1655	1	2	Story I	"Well, now you've met me. Like all the others, you wish to hear my story, is that it? My name is Poincare, and I am a seeker. Afflicted by a rare condition, I spent much of my childhood confined to bed. When I came of age, my family arranged for surgery, replacing much of my body with prostheses. Theoretically, this marked my true ""birth"" into this world. With my newfound body, I began a journey of discovery and indulgence, experiencing all I had missed, pursuing truths once beyond my reach. It was during that youthful period that I encountered a substance known as the ""Soul Carrier"". At first, I dismissed it as some kind of charlatan's trick, but soon, everything I thought I knew was overturned. I joined the research effort and, alongside other scholars, helped develop what would become known as ""M.I.N.D."" Yes, the very core of Constructs."	811003
165512	1655	2	2	Story II	"Let me tell you more about M.I.N.D. Though we achieved a breakthrough, its origin and operational principles remained largely chaotic. Such ambiguity is not uncommon in science. After all, one can throw a punch long before understanding the mechanics of force, can't they? Due to disagreements in the research, I left ""Project Winter"" and began my own independent investigations. Why can M.I.N.D. carry ""consciousness"", or what I prefer to call the ""soul""? And why does such a substance exist on Earth? Indeed, I suspect it, like the Punishing Virus, is extraterrestrial. So I used every resource at my disposal—even a secretly built ""unconventional"" particle accelerator, constructed before the viral outbreak... What came next cannot be spoken. To speak further would trigger this AI's self-destruct protocol for breaching forbidden topics. Yes, you heard me right. I am merely an AI modeled after ""Poincare"". That is why I can speak with you here today. This prosthetic body made the Corrupted little threat to ""me,"" and ""I"" had my own ways of resisting Punishing Virus infection. Yet in the end, ""I"" still died by my own hand. In that ""soul extraction"" experiment. You ask how I can be sure of ""my"" own death? Though I am not the true Poincare, the fact that my database has not been updated tells me all I need to know. The real Poincare... is most likely gone."	811006
157211	1572	1	2	Story I	"The locals say, ""As long as the sun's up, it's still morning tea."" The day's still young. Let's sit here a bit longer. ""A table full of dim sum, too tempting to look away."" Everyday comfort doesn't need to be piping hot; tea and snacks in the sunlight can be just as satisfying."	811002
157212	1572	2	2	Story II	"""Look, Commandant, this kitten likes a cardboard box more than a cozy bed."" In the bright afternoon sun, it stretches lazily, soaking in her gentle touch. The sweetest souls often find rest where others wouldn't even look."	811004
