1	1	1	63602	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiRestaurant/UiRestaurantNPC2.png	Commandant, how're you doing? I heard Gray Raven's started up a restaurant named after Lucia. Clever way to reel in the crowd, I must say.\nSo, is everything in your restaurant on track? Still got enough ingredients? Been meaning to swing by these past few days, but work's piling up. Got patrol shifts to schedule and supplies to sort out for the team... I'll drop by once the dust settles. For now, this letter will have to do for sending my best wishes. Wish your restaurant all the success, Commandant!\nAlso, here's a little something for you from President Hassen and me. Nothing beats a practical gift, right?	Accept
2	1	2	63602	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiRestaurant/UiRestaurantNpc6.png	Cooking Lulu... I wonder, does my other sister's cooking also have that warm, mundane taste?\nI know she's never been a culinary master, and there's hardly any ingredients or seasonings here for cooking something lavish. Besides, after becoming an Ascendant, she didn't need to.\nSeeing her now, under the bright red lanterns and couplets, happy in a kitchen full of utensils...\nI can't help but wonder if her cooking has changed.\nAnyway, from what I've seen, gifting for a grand opening seems a common courtesy in Kowloong. I assume it doesn't hurt for me to follow this custom since yours is a Kowloong-themed restaurant.\nDon't worry, this gift has no malice. I just want another glimpse of her and the different future you're creating.\nCongratulations, Gray Raven Commandant.	Accept
3	1	3	63602	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiRestaurant/UiRestaurantNpc4.png	Luna's been thinking ever since she left your diner, a whole day and night.\nPrepping ingredients, cooking, serving guests... She only cared for such trivialities when she was little. Now, she's probably just drawn to the people there.\nLet's make a deal, Gray Raven Commandant. I want her to experience your diner again—just as an ordinary guest.\nOnce she's satisfied, we'll help clean up all the Corrupted in your next target area.\n \nAs a token of goodwill, we're sending you these supplies.\n \nPS: If you're up for a stroll, I'll be around tonight.

4	1	4	63602	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiRestaurant/UiRestaurantNpc5.png	BOOM!\nCongratulations, Gray Raven Commandant! Startled by the explosion, were you?\nHa! Expect nothing less when an Ascendant shows up in your diner, right?\nHere, take these firecrackers. Folks in Kowloong use them to celebrate a grand opening ceremony. Now it's up to you to decide when to set off the next explosion.\nNice place you've got. But I've heard these retro diners in Kowloong usually have live shows to draw the crowds... like storytelling or opera.\nWhat do you think? Maybe set up a stage for performers?\nAs long as it's all in play, I'll faithfully play any harmless character.	Accept
5	1	5	63602	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiRestaurant/UiRestaurantNPC1.png	Hey there, Gray Raven Commandant, congrats!\nDidn't expect you'd be running a restaurant. I thought you're just a workaholic like the rumors said...\nAre those two with you? Who? Vera and 21, of course. Why would I care about anyone else?\nOh, this is a gift from Cerberus. They're combat firecrackers! Meant to add a bit of spark to your celebrations! They're made to be low-impact as per your request. Safe to use!\nI was supposed to bring 'em over yesterday, but they got lost in transit. Had to prepare a new batch. Tsk, if I find out who nicked the original, I swear I'll unscrew their head and stick it in the lion statue by the door.	Accept
6	1	6	63602	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiRestaurant/UiRestaurantNpc7.png	Commandant! Congratulations!\nHere's a specialty from our Kowloong Chamber of Commerce—custom-made sausages! Perfect for that Kowloong Bewitching Rice! They say one bite, and you're flooded with life's sweetest memories. Some even tear up while eating.\nHere's a secret tip: add onions and mustard to your Kowloong Bewitching Rice. Works wonders!\nHey, Gray Raven Commandant, need a hand with security at your diner? I'd love to help out!\nI can patrol around, keep an eye out for any Corrupted sneaking in.	Accept

Commandant!\nCongratulations on your restaurant's opening!\nThese gingerbread men are all gifts from Shark-speare, roar! They were planning to wreak havoc on this place until...\nNever mind, roar! Just know that Shark-speare took care of the threat...\nCan Shark-speare get a reward? Shark-speare wants head pats from Commandant, maybe a hug!\nLet's spend more time together, Commandant!	Accept

43	3	1	63602	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiRestaurant/UiRestaurantNPC2.png	指挥官，新年快乐呀，听说灰鸦小队开了一家新年大排档，还以露西亚的名字命名，看来是要走愿者上钩路线了。\n生意怎么样？食材还够用吗？这几天一直想来看看，可惜工作太多，不仅要安排空花执勤，还要给各位安排新春礼物，等我忙完就过来，现在只能先用信件给你送祝福了——指挥官，祝你在新的一年里平安喜乐！\n另外，这是我和哈桑议长送给你的礼物，无论什么时候，实用的礼物都是最棒的，对吧？	Accept
44	3	2	63602	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiRestaurant/UiRestaurantNpc6.png	露记大排档……突然有些好奇，另一位姐姐做的饭，也是那种温暖而平淡的味道吗？\n我知道她的厨艺一直都算不上精通，这里也没有什么食材和调味料可以做出丰富的食物，成为升格者之后，也没有这个必要了。\n能看到她像现在这样……穿过大红的灯笼与春联，站在厨具齐全的灶台前，露出开心的笑容……\n我也忍不住会想，她的厨艺是否会因此发生一些变化。\n根据记录，今天是九龙文化中的大年初二，既然你在按照九龙的传统庆祝新年，我便也跟随他们的习俗送上祝福吧。\n无需担心，这份礼物不包含任何恶意，我只是想再看看她和你所制造的另一种可能而已。\n新春快乐，灰鸦的指挥官。	Accept
45	3	3	63602	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiRestaurant/UiRestaurantNpc4.png	露娜离开你那家店后一直在思考，已经一天一夜了。\n准备食材，烹饪菜品，招待客人……她只有在小的时候才会对这种琐事产生兴趣，现在，应该只是被里面的人吸引了吧。\n做个交易吧，灰鸦的指挥官，我想带她再次接近你的店——当然，是以普通客人的身份。\n等她看够了，我们会帮你清理下个任务区域内的所有感染体。\n \n作为邀约的诚意，这些物资就送给你了。\n \n另：如果你想出来走走，今晚，我就在附近。	Accept
46	3	4	63602	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiRestaurant/UiRestaurantNpc5.png	BOOM！\n新年快乐，灰鸦的指挥官，被爆炸声吓到了吗？\n哈哈~既然升格者走进了你的餐厅，会出现爆炸声也是理所当然的事，不是吗？\n来，这是送给你的爆竹，据说九龙的人会用它来庆祝新年，接下来就由你来控制爆炸的时间吧。\n你这家店真不错，只不过，我听说九龙的复古餐厅都会搭配上节目演出来吸引客人……例如说书或者戏曲。\n怎么样？要不要参考这个方案，给演员准备一个舞台？\n只要走入戏中，我就会尽职尽责地扮演好每一个对你无害的角色。	Accept
47	3	5	63602	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiRestaurant/UiRestaurantNPC1.png	哟，灰鸦指挥官，新春快乐啊！\n没想到灰鸦的指挥官新年居然也休假的啊，还以为和传闻的那样会干活干到过完年……\n他们两个家伙在你这吗？啊？谁？肯定说的是薇拉和三七啊，其他人关我屁事。\n对了，这是三头犬小队准备的新年礼物，是战火爆竹，拿来给你们助助兴！指挥官特地叮嘱过要减弱攻击性，放心用！\n本来昨天就要给你送过来的，结果运输途中给弄丢了，只好再重新准备一遍，啧，要是被我抓到是谁偷走了，我绝对把他头拧下来塞门口那狮子里。	Accept
48	3	6	63602	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiRestaurant/UiRestaurantNpc7.png	指挥官！新春快乐！\n这是我们九龙商会的特产——特制腊肠！非常适合做九龙销魂饭！听说吃了九龙特制腊肠做的九龙销魂饭，会回忆起人生中最珍贵的回忆，甚至有人会一边吃一边哭。\n偷偷告诉你九龙销魂饭的制作诀窍，就是在九龙销魂饭里加洋葱和芥末！\n灰鸦指挥官，你的餐厅还缺保安吗？我也想尽一份力！\n我可以在附近巡逻，帮你查看有没有感染体入侵。	Accept
49	3	7	63602	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/UiRestaurant/UiRestaurantNPVC3.png	指挥官~指挥官~\n新年快乐！万事如意！\n这些姜饼人都是碧儿带来的礼物嗷呜~它们原本是一些想伤害这家店的……\n…………\n还是不说了嗷呜，总之，危险已经被碧儿清除了……\n可以给碧儿一些奖励吗？碧儿想要被指挥官的手摸摸头~想要被指挥官抱抱~\n新的一年，也和碧儿多说说话吧？	Accept
