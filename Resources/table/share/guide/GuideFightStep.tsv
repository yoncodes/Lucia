8701040	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Gimme someone tough!	3									
8701041	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	I have seen your ending.	3									
8701042	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	I'm gonna go. All weaklings here, not fun.	3									
8701043	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	...My wrench isn't working. Take care of this for me, I'll go get a new one.	3									
8701044	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	If anyone ever touches me, I'll twist my head off and give it to them!	3									
8701045	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Hehe, I've got a new wrench now. Time to show my true power.	3									
8701046	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Ya need my help? I'm still working on me wrench.	3									
8701047	1	1	Riot Mk.01	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Who's calling for Riot?	3									
8701048	1	1	Riot Mk.01	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	How could you lose with Riot's help? Gotta run.	3									
8701049	1	1	Riot Mk.01	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Big eyes, big powers!	3									
8701050	1	1	Riot Mk.01	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Riot's got your back. No one can mess with you.	3									
8701051	1	1	Riot Mk.01	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Riot will teach them a lesson.	3									
8701052	1	1	Wounded Harvester	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	I used to be a mighty warrior just like you. I was unstoppable, even the Ascendants were no match for me.	3									
8701053	1	1	Wounded Harvester	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	...Till I took an arrow in my arm.	3									
8701054	1	1	Wounded Harvester	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	What??? How could you bully the wounded?!	3									
8701055	1	1	Wounded Harvester	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	What a shame. How outrageous!	3									
8701056	1	1	Wounded Harvester	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Fine... I will make you pay, even at the cost of my arms!	3									
8701057	1	1	Wounded Harvester	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	My injury is nothing compared to this shame!	3									
8701058	1	1	Wounded Harvester	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	A warrior must exceed himself! Move, my arm!	3									
8701059	1	1	Wounded Harvester	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	I may die today, but my legacy will live on!	3									
8701060	1	1	Wounded Harvester	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	My arms are gone, but I still have my legs! Take this!	3									
8701061	1	1	Wounded Harvester	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Will you join me, even after I lose my arms?	3									
8701062	1	1	Wounded Harvester	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Great. My arms may be gone, but my spirit is still high!	3									
8701063	1	1	Wounded Harvester	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Help me up. I still can fight!	3									
8701064	1	1	Yazi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	I only wanted to make a living by selling umbrellas. You forced me to come back!	3									
8701065	1	1	Yazi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Today you shall witness the martial arts of us performers!	3									
8701066	1	1	Yazi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	I will tolerate you no longer!	3									
8701067	1	1	Yazi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	I never thought you would recognize me...	3									
8701068	1	1	Yazi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	You seem to be in trouble. Let me help you!	3									
8701069	1	1	Yazi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Don't panic! They are no match for me.	3									
8701070	1	1	Riot Mk.01	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	It feels... It's that man! He's back.	3									
8701071	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Damn right! I am <size=50>King Wrench XIV</size>, the man with fourteen tricks up his sleeve!	3									
8701072	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	My friend, you still haven't grasped the essence of combat after so many fights?	3									
8701073	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	A fight without BGM is not worth fighting!	3									
8701074	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Riot, I'm counting on you to handle the lighting.	3									
8701075	1	1	Riot Mk.01	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Riot... Rise!	3									
8701076	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Miss Yazi, could you play something for us?	3									
8701077	1	1	Musician Yazi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	But I didn't bring my instrument with me.	3									
8701078	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Then give us a beatbox instead.	3									
8701079	1	1	Musician Yazi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	…………	3									
8701080	1	1	Wounded Harvester	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	So upbeat! Takes me back to the good old days. Let me be your DJ. My hands are at your service!	5									
8701081	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	DJ  Drop the beat!	3									
8701082	1	1	Riot Mk.01	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Now that I'm standing here, you should know what's going to happen. Riot... Rise!	3									
8701083	1	1	Wounded Harvester	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	I pivoted to tap dance after I lost my arms. Now I come here every day to practice.	3									
8701084	1	1	Musician Yazi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Leaving already, mister?	3									
8701085	1	1	Musician Yazi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Do come back.	3									
8701086	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	A fight without BGM is no fight at all.	3									
8701087	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	When will I use my Signature Move, you ask? When the BGM hits its climax, of course.	3									
8701088	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Loud weapons detract from the beauty of battle!	3									
8701089	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	If you ask me, the BGM is too quiet. Bring me a loudspeaker!	3									
8701090	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Bravo! This is how a battle should look like.	3									
8701091	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Why are you looking at me like that? I know what you're thinking.	3									
8701092	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	You honestly think the final condition is to dodge the hit?	3									
8701093	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	We are all brethren here! All the talk about fighting and killing will only drive a wedge between us!	3									
8701094	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	The final condition was met the moment you saw me!	2									
8701095	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	You don't believe me? I will let you see for your own eyes.	2									
8701096	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	If you go to the Observatory one day, remember to turn up the BGM to max!	2									
8701097	1	1	Riot Mk.01	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	You are strong! But now is not the time. See ya.	3									
8701098	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Bravo! Your grasp of music is consummate and your footwork is impeccable. I hereby announce that this is the best laser show ever!	5

8701100	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Told ya no one would like repeated work.	2									
8701101	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	They don't help ya, I do!	2									
8701102	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	This ain't fun. We can practice another day, and I will test your footwork.	2									
8701103	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Riot and others are on leave. Let's catch up when they are free.	2									
8701104	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	No need to say it. I got you!	2									
8701105	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Come! Take these.	2									
8701106	1	1	King Wrench XIV	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	What's this all about? We are family!	2									
8701107	1	1	Bandit	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Hah, are you sure you want to face all ten of us, kid?	2									
8701108	1	1	Bandit	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	I don't know if I should praise your courage or laugh at your stupidity.	2									
8701109	1	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	Just bring it on. You're going to lose anyway.	2									
8701110	1	1	Bandit	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Ouch! Who the heck are you!?	2									
8701111	1	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	Just an ordinary citizen. Remember this lesson!	2									
8701112	1	1	Bandit	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	How could someone... Defeat ten of us without even a scratch...	2									
8701113	1	1	Bandit	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	You have a great future...	2									
8701114	1	1	Bandit	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Tsk... With all our strength... We could barely scratch him...	2									
8701115	1	1	Bandit	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Dammit... Fate no longer favors us... What a pity...	2									
8701116	1	1	Bandit	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	We gave all we had... What a great fight...	2									
8701117	1	1	Bandit	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Young blood like you must not be underestimated...	2									
8701118	1	1	Bandit	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	We had a great fight, until that moment...	2									
8701119	1	1	Bandit	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	I guess this is just life...	2									
8701120	1	1	Bandit	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Dammit... How could we lose!?	2									
8701121	1	1	Bandit	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	I condemn this destiny...	2									
8701122	1	1	Bandit	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Boy, better look at yourself in the mirror before challenging us!	2									
8701123	1	1	Bandit	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Go home. Come back when you are older.	2									
8701124	1	1	Yazi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	King Wrench XIV told me there was a gathering. But I don't see anyone.	0									
8701125	1	1	Yazi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	I actually enjoyed the battle with you. Let me help you out here.	0									
8701126	1	1	Yazi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	I saw you were outnumbered, so I was a bit upset.	0									
8701127	1	1	Yazi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	But they were just too weak. You may as well come to me if you want someone to practice with.	0									
8701128	1	1	Yazi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	You've been coming here quite often. Those guys must have troubled you a lot.	0									
8701129	1	1	Yazi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	I already got rid of them. No need to thank me, just come listen to my music whenever you have time.	0									
8701130	1	1	Riot	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mb1BraveMd010011.png	Where are Wrench and Yazi? They told me there was a gathering!	0									
8701131	1	1	Riot	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mb1BraveMd010011.png	Why call me a no-show? I am only a few weeks late. They are the no-shows!	0									
8701132	1	1	Riot	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mb1BraveMd010011.png	Leave the minions alone. Let's have some fun.	0

8701139	1	1	Tai'E	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Taieyixing01.png	Why are you still fighting?	0									
8701140	1	1	Tai'E	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Taieyixing01.png	Let's go. They're took weak to be of a threat anymore.	0									
8701141	1	1	Tai'E	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Taieyixing01.png	Would you like to go elsewhere with me?	0									
8701142	1	1	Tai'E	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Taieyixing01.png	You are asking if I know other Tai'Es?	0									
8701143	1	1	Tai'E	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Taieyixing01.png	No, not really, since different Tai'Es hold different positions.	0									
8701144	1	1	Tai'E	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Taieyixing01.png	We should focus on getting out of here right now.	0									
8701145	1	1	Tai'E	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Taieyixing01.png	The duty of Tai'E is to protect humanity.	0

8701147	1	1	Tai'E	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Taieyixing01.png	Come, friend, let us get out of here.	0									
8701148	1	1	Tai'E	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Taieyixing01.png	We are trapped in never-ending battles...	0									
8701149	1	1	Tai'E	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Taieyixing01.png	—But we can skip them with Auto Clear!	0									
8701150	1	1	Tai'E	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Taieyixing01.png	Go away. You don't belong here anymore.	0									
8701151	1	1	Tai'E	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Taieyixing01.png	Why are you still here?	0									
8701152	1	1	Tai'E	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Taieyixing01.png	These guys are too weak for you.	0									
8701153	1	1	Tai'E	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Taieyixing01.png	Time to go. Let's go out together.	0									
8701154	1	1	Tai'E	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Taieyixing01.png	The disaster is growing and spreading... But never lose your hope.	0

99960001	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1SS.png	Hello, can I help you?	0									
99960101	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1SS.png	The camera angles were made from switching between two virtual cameras, [io1] and [io2].	0									
99960102	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1SS.png	To load the virtual cameras, you can link them to NPC or world coordinates.	0									
99960103	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1SS.png	"Now you are watching an in-battle story. Simply load it by ""Display Stage Tip + ID"", and you can easily use the play and skip buttons."	0									
99960104	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1SS.png	"You need to put the in-battle story in the ""trunk/Product/Table/Share/Guide/GuideFightStep.tab"" form before loading it in the stage."	0									
99960105	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1SS.png	This is the last line. The camera will be directed back to the player afterward.	0									
99960151	1	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1SS.png	Speaking of it, this is also an in-battle story, lasting approximately 5 seconds.	5									
30090501	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Interesting.	3									
30090502	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi2.png	No one can escape my shots.	3									
30090503	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Good shot!	3

30090532	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka2SS.png	My next song will end your misery!	3									
30090533	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya2.png	This time, I'll protect everyone!	3									
30090534	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu2.png	I hope I didn't drag everyone down.	3									
30090535	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu2S.png	Don't drag Liv down, Commandant!	3									
30090536	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Bring out everything you have!	3									
30090537	1	1	Minghe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Who's that? Is it him...coming to...marry me?	3									
30090538	1	1	Luyao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Oh, sister... Shall we greet him?	3									
30090539	1	1	Chensha	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Stop humiliating ourselves, Yao. Just look at us... What can we possibly do with these filthy bodies?	3									
30090540	1	1	Luyao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Stop it, sister. Why don't we just forget him and live our own happy life?	3									
30090541	1	1	Minghe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Oh darling... Why are you so rude to me!?	3									
30090542	1	1	Chensha	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Now that he is successful, he has forgotten us. Why should I care about such a heartless man?	3									
30090543	1	1	Minghe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Ha, haha... Yao is gone... My Yao... She's gone... Hahaha...	3									
30090544	1	1	Chensha	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	I thought you only wanted Minghe and me...	3									
30090545	1	1	Chensha	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Yao means the world to me. How dare you do this to her? You will all die!	3									
30090546	1	1	Minghe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	...Hah... Nobody will compete with me now...	3									
30090547	1	1	Minghe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	How ruthless of you to murder my sisters... And how stupid of me to let you do it!	3									
30090548	1	1	Minghe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	What a fool I am... What a laughable fate... Ahahahaha!	3									
30090549	1	1	Chensha	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Pff, what a pretentious poser. So weak.	3									
30090550	1	1	Chensha	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Don't worry, sister. I shall take his soul!	3									
30090551	1	1	Chensha	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	……	3									
30090552	1	1	Minghe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Darling! You have already hurt my sisters... Do you really have to do this to me?	3									
30090553	1	1	Chensha	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Ming, we must give this traitor a lesson!	3									
30090554	1	1	Chensha	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Stop, you filthy lecher! This is the final warning!	3									
30090555	1	1	Minghe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	It started from me... And it shall end with me today!	3									
30090556	1	1	Minghe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Ha, ha... Darling, I'll be out soon... I'm coming for you...	3									
30090557	1	1	Yazi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Look at me... Look at this gorgeous, elegant frame of mine... Why are you still staying away?	3									
30090558	1	1	Yazi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	In my dream, my darling was handsome and loving... But now everything is in vain!	3									
30090559	1	1	Yazi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Pff, ha, hahaha! I knew this day would come... He is a heartless man after all...	3									
30090560	1	1	Yazi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Hah! Why would you do this... You're a female too, aren't you?	3									
30090561	1	1	Yazi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Alas... All those days wasted in the ship... Yet, I can't do anything when I face my destruction...	3									
30090562	1	1	Yazi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	It's just my own obsession... Forget me, darling... As I part ways with you...	3									
30090563	1	1	Yazi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Bah! Only a shameless fool would call for help! A true hero shall face me one-on-one!	3									
30090564	1	1	Yazi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Only I can be with my darling... I'll slay anyone who gets in my way!	3									
30090565	1	1	Yazi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Why don't you stay to enjoy this view...? Two lonely people would make a perfect couple, you and me.	3									
30090566	1	1	Yazi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	They say love is like sand, but why do so many clutch at it?	3									
30090567	1	1	Yazi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	The yard covered in frost, a lone wanderer standing under the moon... Could it be my darling finally back?	3									
30090568	1	1	Yazi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Darling... Why are you so heartless...	3									
30090569	1	1	Yazi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Now that you are with someone else... Have you already forgotten me?	3									
30090570	1	1	Yazi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	How dare you show this affection in front of me... How infuriating!	3									
316140001	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Lee, I've sent you the coordinates of the Construct Squad's SOS signal!	2									
316140002	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Find them and contact us. We will help you evacuate. I'm counting on you. Don't get lost!	3									
316140003	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	The corpses of the Construct Squad are everywhere... If I had arrived earlier...	3									
316140004	1	1	Construct Soldier	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/GanrangouzaotiNomal01.png	There are too many Corrupted... The others have retreated to the bridge in the eastern area. We're counting on you...!	3									
316150001	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	According to the Construct Soldier, other squad members should be at the end of this bridge.	3									
316150002	1	1	Construct Soldier	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/GanrangouzaotiNomal01.png	Finally... We're saved...	2									
316160001	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Count the casualties. We'll evacuate from the landing pad in the northern area of the city.	2									
316160002	1	1	Construct Soldier	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/GanrangouzaotiNomal01.png	The Corrupted!!! Again...?	2									
316160003	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Calm down. And get ready to defend!	2									
316160004	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	... The Corrupted are too many...	2									
316160005	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Hero has arrived! You are welcome!	2									
316160006	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	"Perfect timing, ""hero""."	2									
316160007	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	It seems it's over.	2									
316170001	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Send me a signal when you reach the landing pad. I'll come to pick you up.	2									
316170002	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Before that, I'll be supporting you from the air.	2									
316170003	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Coordinates confirmed. Landing in <color=#ff0000>30</color>s.	2									
316170004	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	It seems you still have a lot to do before I arrive.	2									
316170005	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Protect them! We only have one Construct Soldier left!	2									
316170006	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Sorry to keep you waiting.	2									
316180001	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	It's blocking the runway! We have to get rid of it first!	2									
316190001	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Now let's find that special Corrupted. According to the record, this is where it was last seen!	2									
316190002	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	These Polar Soldiers were corrupted after activation. Let's look into this. Maybe we can find something.	2									
316190003	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	The frames were activated 3 hours ago. Whoever did this must want to use them to travel through the blizzard.	2									
316190004	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	The closest place from here is... the port!	2									
316200001	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Satellite data show that a communication signal was sent out from here a while ago. Check the data of the communication device!	2									
316200002	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	This is... a signal to Narwhal! Smart. Using Narwhal to leave. So there won't be any location info left behind.	2									
316200003	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	However, we can do the same thing! Lee, I will sync your data to call Narwhal!	2									
316200004	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Meanwhile, please stay in the sync area. Otherwise, we'll have to start all over!	2									
316210001	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	There's an intense Punishing Virus reaction in surrounding waters. Get ready to fight!	2									
316210002	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Narwhal stopped moving?!	2									
316210003	1	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	What's got it stopped?!	2									
316220001	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	You have nowhere to run!	2									
316220002	1	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Surrender now!	2									
316230001	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	There's a Punishing Virus reaction in the lower area of the factory. And that's what we are tasked to investigate this time.	2									
316230002	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Breaking into the factory from the east entrance according to plan.	2									
316240001	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	The entrance security system is locked! Hacking into it will activate the alarm system of the Corrupted nearby!	2									
316240002	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Let's get ourselves prepared before hacking into the system!	2									
316250001	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	The ID card in your hand has the access to all facilities in the factory and allows you to travel freely in it.	2									
316250002	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	However, the security lock of the facilities will be activated once they are hacked, so don't lose your ID card!	2									
316250003	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	What was I saying? Don't let it run away with the ID card!	2									
316250004	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Looks like we have to hack into the system. This is the only chance we have. Make sure you get the ID card!	2									
316260001	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	It's blocked!	2									
316260002	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Maybe I can make use of these uncorrupted Jitterbombs.	2									
316260003	1	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Dead end?!	2									
316260004	1	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	It's your time, little guys!	2									
316270001	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Done. Let's get out of here.	2									
316270002	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	!!!	2									
316270003	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	This is unbelievable! It's in a dangerous state! Run!	2									
316280001	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	The obelisk seems to have enhanced the Corrupted!	2									
316280002	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	But if we break the obelisk, the transmission overload will also destroy these Corrupted!	2

1010103168	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	By the way, I heard Shark-speare was also here on vacation. Maybe you could track it down?	0									
1010103169	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Let's go.	0

1010103174	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	This is the... front gate! Huh? A'Mao! A'Mao is gone!	3									
1010103175	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	This here is the... Ferris wheel plaza of Venus Splash Park.	3									
1010103176	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	And this... is a hot-air balloon. A lot of people come here to ride it on certain occasions.	3									
1010103177	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Here we have... a bar and a roller coaster! Whether you're seeking rest or thrills, this is the place for you!	3									
1010103178	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	I am Cathy No.5. Let's take a picture together.	3									
1010103179	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	I think Cathy No.1 is riding the Ferris wheel.	0									
1010103180	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Whoa! Shark-speare is here. Go take a picture with her!	3									
1010103200	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Shark-speare's footprints are seen near the dumpster. She's into scavenging too?	3									
1010103201	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Shark-speare's footprints! She must have been here to admire the Ferris wheel.	3									
1010103202	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Shark-speare has probably sat here for quite a while. She must be loving that curtain in the back!	3									
1010103203	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	You found those well-hidden tracks. I'm impressed!	3									
1010103204	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Shark-speare seems to have lingered here for a while. Was she admiring the view?	3									
1010103205	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Shark-speare seems to have taken a lot of pictures of the Ferris wheel from here.	3									
1010103206	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	This is a vantage point. You can see the entire park from up here.	3									
1010103207	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	She seems to have ordered a drink here, but isn't she a minor?	3									
1010103208	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Odd. Shark-speare was here playing music games. Was she inspired by King Wrench XIV?	3									
1010103209	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	She must have left these tracks while playing with the balloon.	3									
1010103210	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	This must be the skateboard Shark-speare used!	3									
1010103211	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	There are tracks of Shark-speare near every dumpster. She must be really into scavenging.	3									
1010103212	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Hiding behind this seems just like the thing that mischievous Shark-speare would do.	3									
1010103213	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Wow! You found Shark-speare's footprints! Great job!	3									
1010103214	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Uh-oh, you've run out of attempts to take pictures. Take a walk around or tap the upper-right corner to exit.	3									
101103001	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	I already scanned their model. Their memory data is most likely stored externally in the chips on their back.	0

101103005	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	It should be an amplifier. Or at least one of its functions is to amplify signals.	0									
101103006	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	...The low-level design of the device is identical to the ship's system. Might have slight differences, but I can't tell yet.	0

102010201	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	According to our instructions, this is the deployment point for the Iso-Devices.	0									
102010202	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	But... Corrupted are still converging en masse.	0									
102010203	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	No doubt driven in this direction by the Iso-Devices of other teams.	0									
102010204	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	First in, best dressed, I guess.	0									
102010205	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	We'll have to hurry... We need to clear out this zone so we can deploy the device.	0									
102010301	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	It'll take a while for each Iso-Field to establish.	0									
102010302	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	And during so, we'll have to draw the enemy away, right?	0									
102010303	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Yes. After a device is deployed, I'll join you.	0									
102010304	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Okay. Let's all do our best!	0									
102010305	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	That went well. The Iso-Device is humming along nicely.	0

102010309	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	We do need to hurry, but we shouldn't let Cerberus dictate our pace.	0

102040307	2	1	Tifa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	I can't let the Princess down...	0									
102040308	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Princess?	0									
102040401	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Commandant, let's use the fog to sneak back upstairs.	0									
102040402	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	This enemy is bad news... Sorry. I'm being a liability.	0									
102040403	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	No, Lee... You're not.	0									
102040404	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	I'm the one who got us into this mess...	0									
102040405	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	(Coughs) It's getting worse... Just put me down...	0									
102040406	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Stuff it already, Lee!	0									
102040407	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	……!?	0									
102040408	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	I'll bring you back, no matter what!	0									
102040409	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Liv...	0									
102040410	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	...Alright, then I'll be counting on you.	0									
102040411	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Corrupted are closing in. We need to hurry.	0									
103010101	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuluomuNomal01.png	Kamui, what's your status?	0									
103010102	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Uh, Chrome... I think I'm lost.	0									
103010103	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuluomuNomal01.png	Just as I thought...	0									
103010104	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuluomuNomal01.png	You're good in a fight, but your sense of direction is appalling...	0									
103010105	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuluomuNomal01.png	Listen up, Kamui, just follow the Navi-Path...	0									
103010106	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Navi? I told you, that thing is useless. It keeps changing directions! It's so annoying...!	0									
103010107	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuluomuNomal01.png	Because it detects threats in real-time and adjusts your route accordingly. The Strike Hawks fight alone, after all.	0									
103010108	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	I've got my instincts! I don't need a Navi to tell me where the danger is!	0									
103010109	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Hang on. There's a Construct up ahead. I'll go ask him the way!	0									
103010110	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuluomuNomal01.png	But there are no friendly signals in your vicinity. Hey! Can you still hear me?	0									
103010111	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	You here on a mission too? Well, ain't that a coincidence!	0									
103010112	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	……	0									
103010113	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Yes. Quite.	0									
103010114	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	I'm looking for the Estate Museum. On my way to reinforce the Gray Raven. Can you point me in the right direction?	0									
103010115	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	That way.	0									
103010116	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Oh, it's that way... Guess my Navi was right, after all. Good luck on your mission too, friend!	0									
103010117	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Don't mention it.	0									
103010118	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Well, well. They do have some interesting people on their side, don't they?	0									
103010201	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	This is where the distress signal originated.	0									
103010202	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	High Construct casualties, but low levels of Punishing Virus...	0									
103010203	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Thankfully, they all recalled their consciousnesses. Their bodies weren't further infected as well.	0									
103010204	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	We should do some preliminary recovery, and find out what happened while we're at it.	0									
103010205	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	They are covered in gunshot wounds.	0									
103010206	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Whatever did this is packing some serious heat. Be on your guard.	0									
103010207	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Look!	0									
103010208	2	1	Heavy Terrapod	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyongganrantiNomal01.png	"Visitor Identification: Thug. Commence program, ""Civil Control""."	0									
103010209	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	It's... one of the Estate Terrapods. Someone must have reactivated it.	0									
103010210	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	How many guns did they cram in this thing? Post-Pandemic Age tech really could use some subtlety...	0									
103010211	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Liv, request backup from nearby team.	0									
103010212	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Okay!	0									
103010301	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Leave these to me!	0									
103010302	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Easy!	0									
103010303	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Wow, he must be a Tank Construct... That onslaught didn't leave a scratch on him.	0									
103010304	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	(Chuckles)	0									
103010401	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	The Estate structures are falling apart, but their control systems seem pretty much intact.	0									
103010402	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	The Estate control systems can be accessed via that Terminal. If we can hack the defense codes, we can shut the systems down.	0									
103010403	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Is that a bionic animal? Cooool!	0									
103010404	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Wow! It's moving!	0									
103010405	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	You—	0									
103010406	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	He's activated the entire museum security system! And it's at the highest alert! That idiot...	0									
103020101	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	These exhibits... look super shady...	0									
103020102	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	But I won't touch them again, I swear!	0									
103020103	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Locked... Tch, of course.	0									
103020104	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Enemies behind us are closing in!	0									
103020105	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	No good way around this. Let's deal with them first.	0									
103020106	2	1	???	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown01.png	That's far enough. Please leave this place, while you still can.	0									
103020107	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Who... said that?	0									
103020201	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	The... the exhibits are being activated!	0									
103020202	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Turn on EM Camo, quickly.	0									
103020203	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	The Beamers ahead are hidden behind a force field. Our attacks will bounce right off.	0									
103020204	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	We'll have to observe their attacks and time our exit carefully. Remember, any hits will disable our EM Camo.	0									
103020205	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Door locks disabled. Let's keep going.	0									
103020301	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Some sort of barrier is blocking access to the courtyard...	0									
103020302	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	There's a high Punishing Virus response... behind the force field.	0									
103020303	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	It must be some kind of lair.	0									
103020304	2	1	Estate Butler	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	It is intended to protect you... This is your last chance...	0									
103020305	2	1	Estate Butler	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Once you pass through this barrier, there's no turning back.	0									
103020306	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Liv, insert your Levi-Gun core into the Terminal. It will short the force field.	0									
103020307	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	On it.	0									
103020308	2	1	Estate Butler	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	……	0									
103020309	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	The force field has been overloaded. We can continue on our way!	0									
103020310	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Let's go.	0									
103020401	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	The fighting there is done. We don't have to rush. Let's clear out the Corrupted nearby first.	0									
103030101	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Phew—mission accomplished.	0									
103030102	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Very thorough. Thank you, Lucia.	0									
103030201	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Those Constructs... look a bit abnormal...	0									
103030202	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Their limbs and Inver-Devices are all destroyed, but they've still got vital signs.	0									
103030203	2	1	Construct	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Stay...	0									
103030204	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	What happened to you? What are you trying to say?	0									
103030205	2	1	Construct	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Stay... back...	0									
103030206	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Someone installed Motion Bombs inside them!	0									
103030207	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	That's so... messed... up...	0									
103030208	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Disarming these bombs isn't possible right now... We can only give them a bit of distance...	0									
103030209	2	1	Estate Butler	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	That's what happens when you oppose the Ascendants—I do not wish to see it happen anymore.	0									
103030210	2	1	Estate Butler	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	But it's too late now. Don't say I didn't warn you.	0									
103030301	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Loyal old Android. He has defended the Estate Museum for a very long time.	0									
103030302	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	It would have ended quite differently if he had just succumbed to the power of Ascnet.	0									
103030303	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	But, such is the fate of the weak.	0									
103030304	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Go. Complete your final task.	0									
103030305	2	1	Estate Butler	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Thank you for releasing me...	0									
103030306	2	1	Estate Butler	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	I... will not allow... them... to defile Mr. Copperfield's legacy...	0									
103030307	2	1	Estate Butler	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Initiating... central nervous system... self-destruct sequence...	0									
103030308	2	1	Estate Butler	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Mr. Copperfield... In the end, I failed you. I couldn't protect the Estate...	0									
103030401	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Lucia.	0									
103030402	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	What?	0									
103030403	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Now show me what you can do.	0									
103030404	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	……	0									
103030405	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	I don't mind if the others join in, but in the end... only one of you will remain.	0									
103030406	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	One of... us?	0									
103030407	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Which one will it be?	0									
103030408	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	You're weak... just like she said.	0									
103030409	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	What... are you saying?	0									
103030410	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Hey punk—	0									
103030411	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Over here!	0									
103030412	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	What?!	0									
104010101	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	You found the monitors?	0									
104010102	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Yeah... but any equipment exposed to the elements could have been infected.	0									
104010103	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Hope they still work. Let me try!	0									
104010104	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	They seem to be working. It must be my lucky day.	0									
104010105	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	We should bring them in for analysis.	0									
104010201	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	We need to find somewhere quiet. The battlefield isn't the place for computational work.	0									
104010202	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	The tremors feel different here. I've got a bad feeling about this.	0									
104010301	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	I'll place some EMP bombs in strategic positions.	0									
104010302	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Cover me, Lee. Don't hold back.	0									
104010303	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	You got me...	0									
104010304	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Take cover! Baby's gonna blow!	0									
104010305	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Those things don't affect us... What were you thinking?	0									
104010401	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	The place is strewn with Corrupted parts...	0									
104010402	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Status?	0									
104010403	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	It's at 20% power. If we're doing something, now would be the time...	0									
104010404	2	1	Zack	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Emma...	0									
104020101	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	It's very hot here. Commandant... are you okay?	0									
104020102	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	In and out. Find a supply point for Commandant.	0									
104020201	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Target sighted! Wow... it looks a lot bigger in real life. What's it called again?	0									
104020202	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Vassago, a kind of bionic Sand Worm. It moves through the sand and ambushes its prey.	0									
104020203	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Remain vigilant. We don't have much experience in this kind of environment.	0									
104020301	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Did you feel that, Lee?	0									
104020302	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Yes. EM Camo. The enemy's using military-grade tech.	0									
104020303	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	They could attack from any direction. Watch your back.	0									
104020304	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Identifying target code... BPO-29, status... Deserter?	0									
104020305	2	1	???	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Lucia? It's you...	0									
104020306	2	1	???	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Looks like... you aren't with the cleaners.	0									
104020401	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Kamui, don't rush in!	0									
104020402	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Worry not! This is the part I'm actually good at!	0									
104020403	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	I don't like that... I'm getting used to his style somehow...	0									
104020404	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Status update?	0									
104020405	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	...And they didn't even clear out the Corrupted here before telling us to set up a supply point?	0									
104020406	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Whatever. More fun for me!	0									
104030101	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	This place will be easy to defend.	0									
104030102	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Why do we have to do all the fighting? Are they afraid or something?	0									
104030103	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	We've got no choice. They're in charge of transport.	0									
104030201	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	I can't believe he laid so many traps.	0									
104030202	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	I just don't have that many folks I can spare, that's all.	0									
104030203	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	I'll get you!	0									
104030301	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Kamui is fighting his own battle. Lee, I need you to take care of fire support. Hurry!	0									
104030302	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Forget about those Corrupted! We've got to get Liv back!	0

104030402	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Is it following us? What does it want?	0									
104030403	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	We don't have time to play with you! Lie down like a good boy! HAIYA!!!	0									
104030404	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Weird. It looked like it was going for Commandant...	0									
104040101	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Commandant... I...	0									
104040102	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	No. I'm sure it'll be fine.	0									
104040103	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Keep your eye on Lucia, Commandant.	0									
104040104	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	While I go shove a sock in Watanabe's mouth.	0									
104040105	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	The Purifying Force... Constructs that kill Constructs…	0									
104040106	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Leave that for later. Let's mop up these wandering enemies first then take a rest.	0									
104040201	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	If you don't believe me, go look at those tombstones.	0									
104040202	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Manhami, Analyzer, Katana specialist, Lazy dullard, November.	0

104040205	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Fresh meat for the grinder... You'll help fight, yes?	0									
104040301	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Surrender! I'm not going to kill any Constructs.	0									
104040302	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	I refuse!	0									
104040401	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Watanabe can take care of Liv for us.	0									
104040402	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Maybe we should put some distance between us and the enemy, Commandant.	0									
104040403	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	……	0									
104040404	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	I'll stop 'em. You get Lee out of here, Commandant!	0									
105010101	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	We need to move fast. I just hope Kamui's map is accurate...	0									
105010102	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Don't make too much noise. We don't want to alert the Forsaken. They're still holding Liv...	0									
105010201	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	This facility is probably rigged. Stay sharp...	0									
105010202	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lee? Kamui?!	0									
105010203	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	What is it?	0									
105010204	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Gone...?	0									
105010205	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Visual system errors? Disorder in the M.I.N.D.?	0									
105010206	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	The Corrupted signals have recovered. We'll have to fight... It won't hurt them, will it?	0									
105010301	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	The next batch of projectors is in position.	0									
105010302	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Follow my mark.	0									
105010401	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Graviton detector imaging has commenced. The image is fuzzy, but will suffice.	0									
105010402	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	But these Corrupted aren't projections.	0									
105010403	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	How did the Forsaken get through here with no Graviton Detectors?	0									
105010404	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	I guess they know this place... Why else would they bring Liv here straight?	0									
105020101	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	If we want the EMP to affect the maximum number of projectors, we need to find the best spot.	0									
105020102	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	There's Corrupted everywhere. I'll send a signal when the coast is clear.	0									
105020103	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	The Corrupted attacks are slowing...	0									
105020104	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	NOW!!!	0									
105020105	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Okay.	0									
105020201	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	You said to not let Kamui out of our sights. Is there something?	0									
105020202	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Well, seeing how we're on the dedicated Gray Raven channel...	0									
105020203	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	I was just checking Kamui's Inver-Device...	0									
105020204	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	It was running on high-load mode. And there are logs of him trying to turn off his GPS and Comms systems.	0									
105020205	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Turning off his own...	0									
105020206	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	He might have his own plans... but I think we definitely need to check in with him more.	0									
105020301	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Corrupted are shielding the projectors...	0									
105020302	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	The one in the middle seems different. I think it must hold the secret to this place.	0									
105020303	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Okay, here goes!	0									
105020401	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Commencing capture of next target.	0									
105020402	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Kamui, don't damage its memory shell.	0									
105020403	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Haha, as long as I don't hit him directly, he'll be fine...	0									
105020404	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Done—over to you, Lee.	0									
105030101	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Show Nanami the M.I.N.D. or you'll regret it—	0									
105030102	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	WA-POW!	0									
105030103	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Such strength! Not even a scratch?!	0									
105030104	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Pffft! This is boring!	0									
105030105	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami's had enough.	0									
105030201	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	This place looks quite oriental. It takes me back...	0									
105030202	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	……	0									
105030301	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	We're in Liv's M.I.N.D. She's already showing signs of the Punishing Virus.	0									
105030302	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Tch. That Watanabe... He best get ready for a beating after this...	0									
105030303	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Liv!	0									
105030401	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Don't hold back, Lucia! We might not get another chance!	0									
105030402	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	(Deep breaths) Very well...	0									
105030403	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Liv...	0									
106010101	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	We're on top of Underground Refugee City 019. During the Post-Pandemic Age it was home to half a million refugees.	0									
106010102	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	That's about one-third of Babylonia's current population. Of course, it all ended in tragedy.	0									
106010103	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Corpses are piled high at the exits... indicating the severity of the final crisis that erupted inside...	0									
106010104	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Our objective is the Ascendants. Let the archeologists take care of history.	0									
106010105	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Wait. Something's climbing up under the elevator!	0									
106010106	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Finally, some movement.	0									
106010107	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	The door's open.	0									
106010201	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	We need to cross the walkway to keep moving down.	0									
106010202	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Hurry. We don't want to get caught out on a bridge.	0									
106010203	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Haha! Lucia knows her away around a battlefield!	0									
106010204	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Everyone, I've picked up... a familiar signal.	0									
106010205	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Executing purification mission, target: Forsaken...	0									
106010301	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	That Corrupted used to be... a giant omni-directional mobility firefighting device...	0									
106010302	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	So what you're saying is... it knows hydro-pump!	0									
106010401	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Hey. Why have we got fewer Corrupted than the Forsaken? You been slacking off or something?	0									
106010402	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	It's not a competition...	0									
106010403	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Snap out of it, Nanami. You helping or not?	0									
106010404	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	I'm waiting!	0									
106010405	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	For what?	0									
106010406	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	The one behind you!	0									
106020101	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	We can deal with Kamui later. Our top priority is clearing the path ahead.	0									
106020102	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Commandant, hold your position at the center of the group until we pass.	0									
106020201	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	That Strike Hawk deserted...	0

106020203	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	I know full well how that's like.	0									
106020204	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	You seem pretty composed being a target...	0									
106020205	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	How come...	0									
106020206	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	When there's still so many Corrupted... covert action is the only option.	0									
106020301	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	The girl was right. The isolation doors are still working.	0									
106020302	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Liv, close the door. I'll clear things up with Kamui... once the mission is complete.	0									
106020303	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Door closed! Everyone, go and help Nanami.	0									
106020401	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	I'll start laying out the detonators.	0									
106020402	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Gray Raven, you are responsible for clearing the Corrupted in this vicinity.	0									
106020403	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	No! The road collapsed...	0									
106020404	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Kid, you go back first. Destroying the source of Corrupted is my task.	0

106030103	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Her voice... sounds familiar... ugh...	0									
106030104	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Lucia, are you okay? Everyone... proceed with caution!	0									
106030201	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Up in the sky a... friendly transporter... but we didn't call for backup.	0									
106030202	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	If they're coming uninvited... then they must be the Purifying Force.	0									
106030301	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	I've got Kamui's signal. He's not far!	0									
106030302	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Kamui...	0									
106030303	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Hurry! We cannot afford to waste time!	0									
106030401	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Sorry, Bianca, Karenina. I can't let you go any further.	0									
106030402	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	It's okay. Let's settle this then.	0									
106040201	2	1	Corrupted	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	I will not let you take them!	0									
106040202	2	1	Corrupted	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Everyone is precious to me!	0

106040303	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Unidentified force on the radar!	0									
106040401	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	So they're sending in Bianca's team...	0									
106040402	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Ol' geezer, you know them?	0									
106040403	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	You could say that. Fought with them before, even.	0									
106040404	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	They must be quite formidable, then.	0									
106040405	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Even if they're the Purifying Force, I won't back down!	0

107010103	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	And what is this drill rig doing here?	0									
107010201	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	They're going to bring the whole place down! Stop them!	0									
107010301	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	The path splits up. There's no time...	0

107020101	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	I've marked the optimal sites to place the Disruptor.	0									
107020102	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	No! There's no time. We need to get out of here before we're completely surrounded!	0									
107020201	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	No, it's a signal transmitter!	0									
107020202	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	A trap... No doubt we have been exposed.	0

131301204	2	1	Construct Captain	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal04.png	Destroy that device so they won't be much of a threat to us.	0									
131301205	2	1	Construct Captain	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal04.png	...So, do you know what to do?	0									
131301206	2	1	Construct Soldier	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Locate the corrupted signaling device with the radar detector and shoot them with precision...!	0									
131301207	2	1	Female Construct	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotinvNormal01.png	I disagree. We could reveal our own coordinates and attract the Corrupted here.	0									
131301208	2	1	Construct Captain	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal04.png	So whoever finds that signaling Corrupted, immediately contact the others to launch a decapitation strike.	0

131301210	2	1	Female Construct	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotinvNormal01.png	I object. The built-in radar detector in the frame is damaged. It's very hard to conduct a detection task of such high precision.	0									
131301211	2	1	Construct Captain	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal04.png	Then use the high-precision radar in our tactical equipment instead. We have to find a higher location... There has to be a suitable location nearby.	0

131301214	2	1	Construct Soldier	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	If we activate the radar near there, the Corrupted will be gathering even faster, which will leave us no time to retreat.	0

302010403	2	1	Browning	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	We aren't equipped for this.	0									
302010404	2	1	Browning	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Pull back to the bridge!	0									
302010405	2	1	Goldfinch Member	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Unknown force field detected. If we continue towards the bridge, we'll get shredded...	0									
302010406	2	1	Browning	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Cover me while I set up a terminal to lift the field!	0									
302010407	2	1	Browning	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	There's one more, waiting in ambush... OPEN FIRE!!!	0									
302010501	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Commandant, this one's different. Normally I'd suggest pulling back...	0									
302010502	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	But we've got to stop it emitting that distress signal.	0									
302010503	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	They just keep coming! There's no time! Take it down, Commandant!	0									
302010601	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lee still hasn't found Liv... Sorry. I shouldn't have been distracted...	0									
302010602	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	The Construct models outside are no longer used in Babylonia.	0									
302010603	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	I've been observing closely. There's no guards beyond the hideout. Please stay here, Commandant...	0									
302010604	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	I'm going to copy their combat logs. Maybe we can get some intel...	0									
302010605	2	1	Unknown Construct	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/GanrangouzaotiNomal01.png	Gold... Gold...	0									
302010606	2	1	Unknown Construct	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/GanrangouzaotiNomal01.png	The Queen gives us... hope.	0									
302010607	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	The Queen...?	0									
302010701	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	So the Mechanoid Guards were using these secret tunnels for rapid deployment.	0									
302010702	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	The tunnels are covered in tin, blocking electrical signals of any forces moving through them.	0									
302010703	2	1	Iron Maiden	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Construct... are you a royal guard, or slave?	0									
302010704	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	You sneak along behind me and never show yourself. I almost thought you were being shy.	0									
302010705	2	1	Iron Maiden	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	I've decided. You must be a slave.	0									
302010706	2	1	Iron Maiden	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	The Queen... needs me...	0									
302010707	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	She has the ability to overpower me... so why is she running?	0									
302010801	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Fighting on constricted terrain eliminates the enemy's numerical advantage.	0									
302010802	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	But it doesn't leave much space for evasion.	0									
302010803	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Commandant, Lee and I aren't in very good shape. For this battle, you'll need to access Construct operating systems.	0									
302010804	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lower performance could cause Dodge lag and other problems. I'd feel better if you had access.	0									
302010805	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	If you don't mind, Commandant...	0									
302010806	2	1	Iron Maiden	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	My dream... is over...	0									
302010901	2	1	Browning	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	I've got to reduce Construct energy consumption... to save energy...	0									
302010902	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Please stay by me when I fight.	0									
302010903	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Let me take care of the fighting. I'll keep you safe.	0									
302011001	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	It's unbelievable how many guards are lurking under the sand!	0									
302011002	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Browning, you're in charge of the Excavator. I'll stop the guards.	0									
302011003	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Guards have been pushed back. Browning, is everything okay?	0									
302011004	2	1	Browning	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Don't come over here!	0									
302011101	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Huh? The combat system has security measures...?	0									
302011102	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Why didn't Browning mention it...?	0									
302011103	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Stay calm, Liv... I need to beat them to change the energy protocols.	0									
302011104	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	...How?!! There are no energy protocols! It's a dummy system!	0									
302020101	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	So many guards... If you can't fix the defense systems, get over here! I'm in trouble!	0									
302020102	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	I'll just grab one to examine.	0									
302020103	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	So the siren has three alarms.	0									
302020104	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	The first two alert the guards. The third one goes to a proxy terminal.	0									
302020105	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	This thing is basically useless now.	0									
302020201	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Why are they all kneeling here?	0									
302020202	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	... Besides the battle damage, they're in pretty good shape.	0									
302020203	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	More guards... They just never end.	0									
302020204	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Goldfinch, can your people still fight?	0									
302020301	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Encountered an ambush. Elimination begins.	0									
302020302	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Out of my way, I don't have time to waste with you.	0									
302020303	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	The guards closing in are growing in number...	0									
302020304	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Can't stay too long. Get out of here quickly.	0									
302020401	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	If I'm not mistaken, these engines drive those artificial sandstorms around the Golden Vortex.	0									
302020402	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	But it stands to reason there must be more engines to generate so many sand storms.	0									
302020403	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	My people... probably aren't trapped here.	0									
302020404	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	I've been spotted! Better deal with these guys first...	0									
302020405	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Did someone rob a bank? This place is crawling with guards.	0									
302020406	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Better rush over, just in case.	0									
302020501	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	I'm standing right in front of them and still nothing? Maybe these Mechanoids aren't guards after all.	0									
302020502	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Looks like they've got some kind of golden ring marked on them... Hard to tell what it is.	0									
302020503	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	What's that sound...? It's been ringing for ages...	0									
302020504	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Da-da-di-da, di-di-da, di, di, da-di. What could it mean?	0									
302020601	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	I'm not gonna fight you, at least not now.	0									
302020602	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	This place is crawling with guards. And I only just found my people.	0									
302020603	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	...Where is he?	0									
302020604	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	If I can flush him out, have his men draw the guards' attention, he's bound to make an appearance.	0									
302020605	2	1	Unconscious Forsaken	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Ah! Run! Shhh! The Warden's coming!	0									
302020606	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Got to make sure those guards don't hurt him.	0									
302020607	2	1	Unconscious Forsaken	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Run! Run! He's coming! Run!	0									
302020608	2	1	Unconscious Forsaken	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	I'm so scared... Leader, save me...	0									
302020621	1	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	There you are.	2									
302020622	1	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	...You used my people?	2									
302020701	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Roland's probably cowering inside. There's no gold dust floating around in here.	0									
302020702	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Fancy being brought to your knees by a spec of gold dust.	0									
302020703	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	You're... no match for me...	0									
302020704	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Whatever. I know you're gonna call in reinforcements.	0									
302020705	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	It doesn't matter who you send, the gold dust has turned you all into jelly!	0									
302020706	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	……	0									
302020707	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Gold dust doesn't just weaken the enemy, it interferes with their ability to tell friend from foe...	0									
302020708	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	...I'll just have to kill you myself!	0									
302020709	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	...I didn't come here to fight meaningless battles.	0									
302020721	1	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Garbage! Aim at the enemy!	2									
302020801	2	1	The Forsaken	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Shh... I know you... You know our leader Watanabe, right?	0									
302020802	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	...You're a Forsaken?	0									
302020803	2	1	The Forsaken	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Quiet... Don't let the Warden hear you... He's hiding among the hostages...	0									
302020804	2	1	The Forsaken	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Cough... cough... Beware the Warden...	0									
302020805	2	1	Hostage	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	...Finally, someone has come to save us.	0									
302020806	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	"So... you must be the ""Warden"". If not for the Forsaken, you might have tricked me."	0									
302020807	2	1	Hostage	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	You dare oppose the will of the Queen!?	0									
302020808	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Can you stand, human?	0									
302020809	2	1	Hostage	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	No... I can't...	0									
302020810	2	1	Hostage	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Help me... Take my hand...	0									
302020811	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	It's okay. I'll get you out...	0									
302020901	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Everyone okay?	0									
302020902	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	The guards have defeated some Forsaken.	0									
302020903	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	They came here to help me...	0									
302020904	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Forsaken, stand up! The battle's not over!	0									
302020905	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	Keep going! The battle's not over!	0									
302020906	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	There's a few more left... Let me repay that volley with interest!	0									
302030101	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Release antibodies... and send me more guards...	0									
302030102	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Nithart... might be the toughest... opponent I've ever faced...	0									
302030103	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Still... these guards... pose no threat to an Ascendant...	0									
302030104	2	1	Nithart	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NiteNomal.png	You put up a good fight, but you might need more antibodies.	0									
302030105	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Antibodies... mean nothing... to an Ascendant...	0									
302030106	2	1	Nithart	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NiteNomal.png	You made no attempt to surrender, that's good.	0									
302030107	2	1	Nithart	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NiteNomal.png	Show me your full strength as an Ascendant.	0									
302030201	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Leave her be for a while...	0									
302030202	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	I can defeat the enemies safely with her barrier.	0									
302030203	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Hey! How was Nanami's performance?	0									
302030204	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Enough! There is still some distance away from the main building. Come with me!	0									
302030205	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Alright... And you're not even praising Nanami...	0									
302030301	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Ding-Ding-Dong... Ding-Ding-Dong... What are you installing, Karenina?	0									
302030302	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	There are so many guards. Don't tell me you're still gonna barge in by yourself.	0									
302030303	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	It's time for me to do some improvisation.	0									
302030304	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	"Introducing my ""automatic cannon"" device. With it and my firepower, the guards pose no threat to us."	0									
302030401	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	So many Corrupted! So exciting! Nanami loves it!	0									
302030402	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Core parts for hacking can definitely be found from these waves of Corrupted.	0									
302030403	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Nanami is going to find it!	0									
302030404	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Congratulations, Nanami... Core parts get!	0									
302030405	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Hm...? A reinforcement request?	0									
302030406	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	All Corrupted... Come to my coordinates... Eliminate all your obstacles...	0									
302030407	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Whoa! Amazing!	0									
302030408	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Your reinforcements will be right there, Roland!	0									
302030501	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	One transceiver terminal is not enough to avoid disruptions while rebuilding the channel.	0									
302030502	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	The guards are definitely gonna notice once the terminal is on... It's so damn heavy too...	0									
302030503	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Where even is Nanami!	0									
302030504	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Channel 1 restored in one go... Luck is on my side.	0									
302030505	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Internet channel restored... for perhaps a few minutes...	0									
302030506	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Whatever! I need to quickly upload the antibody's analysis report.	0									
302030601	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	1, 2, 3... and the one blocked by you, there are 4 air outlets in total.	0									
302030602	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	We can only do two of them... These guards are required for the remaining...	0									
302030603	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Quick! Nanami! Stuff the guards in!	0									
302030604	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Must have them all collapse... on the air outlets...	0									
302030605	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Then their mobility will be limited... after Nithart reconnects to them.	0									
302030606	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	"Ah, Nanami has seen some of the defeated guards came alive. So they were ""reconnected""!"	0									
302030607	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	That's right... Seems like only a few of them can be reconnected.	0									
302030608	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	The influence of the antibodies weakened...	0									
302030609	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Nanami... Thank you! I owe you one.	0									
302030610	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Naughty Roland! Hmph!	0									
302030611	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	...Partially utilizing the Punishing Virus is impracticable, huh. As expected.	0									
302030612	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Naughty Roland, Nanami's gonna bring you home!	0									
302030701	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	A Construct kneeling before a guard... Is that supposed to be an insult towards us?	0									
302030702	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Wait! The guard's cognition device contains the blueprint of the Golden Vortex.	0

302030705	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	We can't... There's an extract permission, and we only... have two chances...	0									
302030706	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Also, some of the blueprints are fake...	0									
302030707	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	What if... we extract the fake one?	0

302031003	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Hurry up! Connect the guard's system for me!	0									
302031004	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Nanami is isolated and helpless, I have to get in and help her!	0									
302031101	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Just put on the bio-booster arms found by Nanami! I can feel the tremendous power inside them!	0									
302031102	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	I should try them on the Queen's guards later!	0									
302031103	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	But first, I need to test the arms' strength...	0

302031108	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	But what about the front door?	0									
302031109	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Don't worry. I can pry it open with one hand!	0

302040203	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Nanami has once connected to Nithart's network for a short time. If she says there's a key, there must be one.	0									
302040204	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	It used to be a Construct. The hole in its security system allowed it to shortly get rid of Nithart's control...	0									
302040205	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Scatter! Find the Construct guard! Find the traitor!	0									
302040206	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	I've just hacked into it, but I couldn't find any keys...	0									
302040207	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Don't give up! Bianca also found a Construct guard, let's go there now!	0									
302040208	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Successfully hacked... but still there's no key in it...	0

302040301	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Too many guards here. No point wasting my energy with them...	0									
302040302	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	We can operate them to battle after transferring their control to my virtual control console...	0									
302040303	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	But I can only build one virtual control console with the materials I have...	0									
302040304	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	One virtual control console can only hijack one guard's control...	0									
302040305	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Which one should we choose?	0									
302040401	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Commandant, I see Nanami on the platform far from our right side...	0									
302040402	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	She must have dropped into the wrong tunnel and eventually fell there.	0									
302040403	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	She's not the type to keep quiet.	0									
302040404	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Watch out, Nithart's guards are coming at us through the other entrance.	0									
302040405	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	She won't let go of us easily. So get ready to fight!	0									
302040406	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Commandant, Nanami is fighting alone, please closely monitor her frame's condition...	0									
302040501	2	1	Nithart	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NiteNomal.png	Look what I've got you...	0									
302040502	2	1	Nithart	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NiteNomal.png	Exhibit again that conceit you've shown me before, or my guards will turn you into scrap.	0									
302040503	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	...Most cunning. Thankfully, I'm her opponent.	0									
302040504	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	I have to return to Commandant as quickly as possible.	0									
302040505	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	It's the last...	0									
302040506	2	1	Nithart	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NiteNomal.png	Destroy her! This is an order from the Queen! Destroy her!	0									
302040601	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	The virus has damaged the security process of the energy system. Our hacking is going well so far!	0									
302040602	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	"Implant the ""anti-virus programs""..."	0									
302040603	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	If we're able to send these anti-virus programs to the corrupted zone, the infection speed will be greatly slowed down...	0									
302040604	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	I've already defeated two Corrupted outside...	0									
302040605	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	"Keep pushing! Don't lose to ""yourself,"" Kamui!"	0									
302040606	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	The corrupted zone is ahead...	0									
302040607	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	This should buy some time for the Gray Raven, right?	0									
302040701	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Unable to open?! What does that mean! I managed to crack into it...	0									
302040702	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	That's because your crack is one-way only. You can only open all security doors if you execute the crack.	0									
302040703	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	But in that case, the guards can also get in and surround us.	0									
302040704	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	"So, apart from an ""open door"" function, we need a ""close door"" one as well. The two actions must be done at the same time."	0									
302040705	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	"Easy-peasy! I can connect the two cracking devices to the same ""repeater"". Problem solved."	0									
302040706	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	"Well, repeating is the easy part. The difficult part is that the second cracking device has to connect the ""closing"" system."	0									
302040707	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	As door opening and door closing are two separate systems, we can only crack it one by one.	0									
302040708	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Lucia and the others are defending against the guards outside. We have to crack the door closing system quickly.	0									
302040709	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	You need to be quick. As more and more guards are trying to break through the exterior wall, they will break through our defense soon...	0									
302040710	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Right... But why did the crack fail? Definitely nothing to do with my devices.	0									
302040711	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Yes, Nithart crashed the system on purpose while we were cracking. That's why it failed.	0									
302040712	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	I'll connect the door closing system to my virtual console. If she does that again, she'll be redirected to it.	0									
302040713	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Operating the final crack... Security doors opened...	0									
302040714	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	...Everyone, through the security door! Quick!	0									
302040715	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lee...	0									
302040716	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Okay. Operating the final crack... Security doors closed...	0									
302040801	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Watch your front and back, the guards are tightening the encirclement...	0									
302040802	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	We have to destroy them all to prevent them from attacking the rescue aircraft.	0									
302040803	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	The royal guards are very difficult to handle. If we don't want to be attacked from both sides, we'd better concentrate our firepower on one side first.	0									
302040804	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Commandant, quick! Which side! I'm gonna blow them all to smithereens!	0									
302040901	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Nithart... she turned off the external sensorium of her frame.	0									
302040902	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	She and the royal guards have already fused into one. Even if we concentrate our firepower on her, we'll still be unable to interrupt the guards' attack.	0									
302040903	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Just blow 'em all up!	0									
302040904	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Can we attack now? Nanami wants to fight!	0									
302040905	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	The Golden Vortex will turn into an inferno soon. We'd better go now. We can't let Nithart be on our way...	0									
302040906	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Commandant, let's make a clean break with Nithart.	0

303152107	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Now, let's get started.	0									
303152108	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Wait for it to move near the white line on the left.	0									
303152109	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	And tap the button on the left to clear it.	0									
303152110	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Light beams will come out both from the left and the right.	0									
303152111	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	The light beam on the right is <color=#00CCFF>Blue</color>. When it moves near the white line on the right,	0

303152113	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Now let's give it a go.	0									
303152114	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	When the light beams on both sides are identical, they will be in <color=#FFCC00>yellow</color>.	0									
303152115	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	And you need to tap both buttons at the same time to clear them.	0									
303152116	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Give it a try.	0									
303152117	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	And then, a new note will show up.	0									
303152118	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	It is comprised of two light beams front and back and an arrow in between.	0									
303152119	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	You need to tap the button when the first light beam reaches the white line and keep pressing it	0									
303152120	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	until the second light beam reaches the white line.	0									
303152121	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	During one [Pressing and holding] action, points and massive Combo will be generated both when you press and release.	0

303152169	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Finally, <color=#FFCC00>[Press and Hold]</color> on both sides!	3									
303152170	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Perfect!	3									
303152171	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Great!	3									
303152172	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Almost there! Don't give up!	3									
303152201	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Hello, Commandant.	0									
303152202	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	I'll start the calibration program guide. Please make adjustments according to the instructions.	0									
303152203	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Tap the [+] and the [-] buttons to adjust the effective position of hitting the notes.	0									
303152204	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	When the [Deviation] is 0, the hit position will overlap the white line.	0									
303152205	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	The lower the [Deviation], the more the position will be moved forward.	0									
303152206	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	After the adjustments are done, tap the [Save] button to save and exit the calibration program.	0									
303152207	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Moving the effective position to where suitable will help you score higher.	0									
303152208	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	So please set a suitable [Deviation] that suits you.	0									
303152209	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	This is the end of the tutorial. Happy gaming.	0									
313010301	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	It's about time.	0									
313010302	2	1	Kuroro	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Ku?	0									
313010303	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	We can't keep Commandant and Liv waiting.	0									
313010304	2	1	Kuroro	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Kukukuku!	0									
313010305	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Phew... Okay, that should be enough.	0									
313010306	2	1	Kuroro	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Kukukukukukukuuu...	0									
313010307	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	...Merry Christmas to you all as well.	0

313010403	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Whoa, so many bad boys here. Nanami is a good girl who refuses to resort to brute force!	0									
313010404	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Then I should cut more trees quietly without being noticed by them!	0									
313010405	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Yeah! Go!	0									
313010406	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Hm, it looks good, and is far from the Corrupted.	0									
313010407	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Even if I emit some noises, they won't notice when they're cutting trees, right?	0									
313010408	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	Okay! Start!	0									
313010409	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	These guys... They're just cutting at nothing now, but still aren't stopping...	0									
313010410	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png	It's getting boring. Nanami's bringing the Christmas tree back! Bye bye!	0

313010701	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	The door blocks our way.	0									
313010702	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	What a nuisance. Just bomb 'em with the bugs!	0									
313010703	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Lucia came up with the plan anyway, so she should be the one who has to take care of the consequences.	0									
313010704	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	I'll ring the bell before those boomboxes arrive.	0									
313010705	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Hold on, the bell is so rotten that even a single touch will ruin it!	0									
313010706	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Well, I don't care. At least the firework can start on time.	0									
313010901	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	The Gray Raven folks are so cold. They're all celebrating Christmas together without inviting me!	0									
313010902	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	I even prepared some gifts for them! Since I'm not invited...	0									
313010903	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Let me sneak in from the roof to surprise them...	0									
313010904	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Hm? What are those Corrupted doing? Do they also celebrate Christmas?	0									
313010905	2	1	Kuroro	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Kuku... Kuuu...	0

313010907	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Kuroro? How did you become so tiny?	0									
313010908	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Wow, you guys are picking on the weak!	0									
313010909	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Don't be afraid! I'm coming to rescue you!	0									
313010910	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Alright, all Corrupted were gone. Are you okay, buddy?	0									
313010911	2	1	Kuroro	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Kuku—ku? Kuku, kuku!!	0									
313010912	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Hm? No need to thank me! It was nothing, hahaha!	0									
313010913	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	This is—a Santa Claus costume. Are you going to give it to me as a thank-you gift?	0									
313010914	2	1	Kuroro	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Ku?	0									
313010915	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Great! That's exactly what I want!	0									
313010916	2	1	Kuroro	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Kukuku?	0									
313010917	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	You should leave too, so that you don't get bullied by the Corrupted again, buddy!	0									
313010918	2	1	Kuroro	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Ku? Ku? Ku? Ku? Ku?	0									
313010919	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Thanks! Merry Christmas! Bye—	0									
313011101	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Is this one of those... shrines? Where humans used to worship gods in the Golden Age.	0									
313011102	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Do I really have to wear this...?	0									
313011103	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	...Whatever, if Luna wants to see this outfit.	0									
313011104	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	There are no gods in this world. Even if there are, they can't save me.	0									
313011105	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	But... What if...	0									
313011106	2	1	???	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyongganrantiNomal01.png	(Rustling noises)	0									
313011107	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Tsk, how annoying!	0									
313011108	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	...Gods, if you do exist.	0									
313011109	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Please, make sure Luna is safe.	0									
313011110	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	...Even if gods can't do it, I will make it happen.	0									
313011111	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Better keep going. Luna's waiting for me.	0									
313011201	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Almost there.	0									
313011202	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	—I only need to get rid of these trash first.	0									
313011203	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Okay. I should be able to make it on time.	0									
313011204	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	...Wait for me. I will be there for you, right in the first minute of the new year.	0									
313011401	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1S.png	Phew... Only two areas of combat test mission left to go.	0									
313011402	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1S.png	It was Miss Ayla's request to test the New Year Coating's combat adaptability...	0									
313011403	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1S.png	But this is still too...	0									
313011404	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1S.png	No, I must stop thinking. Liv, finish your mission first!	0									
313011405	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1S.png	Miss Ayla is so good... She is not hindered by the outfit at all.	0									
313011406	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1S.png	I wish I can wear this and go to a shrine with everyone of Gray Raven...	0									
313011501	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1S.png	Alright, one final mission left.	0									
313011502	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1S.png	Let's begin!	0									
313011503	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1S.png	Oops, it's almost 12am!	0									
313011504	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1S.png	I'm not in the shrine... But...	0									
313011505	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1S.png	Dear God, I wish all the members of Gray Raven will always be together.	0									
313011506	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1S.png	I hope Commandant can stay safe...	0									
313011507	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1S.png	Thank you, God.	0									
313011508	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1S.png	Alright, time to go back. Commandant and others are waiting for me.	0									
313020201	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Let's go, Commandant.	0									
313020202	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Commandant, that Corrupted that has been acting as a leader is about to run off. Let's go after it.	0									
313020203	2	1	Corrupted	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LangrenNormal01.png	—! —!	0									
313020204	2	1	Corrupted	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LangrenNormal01.png	—!	0									
313020205	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Save your breath. Commandant and I won't spare any single one of Corrupted.	0									
313020206	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Still late... Tch!	0									
313020207	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	...Something has exposed my location for sure.	0									
313020208	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Never mind, I was just talking to myself.	0									
313020301	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	I didn't know consciousness connection would be that different from usual.	0									
313020302	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	I'm like Commandant's little doll. Please take good care of us, will you?	0									
313020303	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Wait... In this sense...	0									
313020304	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	It seems that the connection between Commandant and here is over. We'll search this area shortly.	0									
313020305	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	I'll give it my all, Commandant!	0									
313020401	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Speaking of which, Commandant, have you noticed that some of our voice messages weren't censored?	0									
313020402	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Perhaps it can be used to recognize our true identities.	0									
313020403	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Will recognizing who we are... really help us get through this situation?	0									
313020404	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Commandant, it seems you have to change your connection target.	0									
313020405	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Will the next guy find Commandant?	0									
313020406	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Not sure, but we've already narrowed down the range of searching area. We should be able to calculate Commandant's location very soon.	0									
313020407	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	I'll see you at that place, Commandant.	0									
313020501	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu2.png	Consciousness connection...	0									
313020502	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu2.png	In a nutshell, Commandant exists within my body in addition to ■■■■■, right?	0									
313020503	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu2.png	Let us show you the power of the trio, Corrupted!	0									
313020504	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu2.png	Ah, It's the message from ■■■■■. I'll go to the rendezvous point too.	0									
313020505	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu2.png	Commandant, wait for me!	0									
313020801	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	I'll repeat the rules, just for you.	0									
313020802	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Those standing before you are the Constructs closest to you.	0									
313020803	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	The reason they become like this is because of your cognitive bias.	0									
313020804	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Next, I'll ask questions like which one is the real Liv and which one is the real Kamui.	0									
313020805	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	What you need to do is to point out their true identities.	0									
313020806	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Of course, it'd be great if you're right. But if you're wrong—	0									
313020807	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Nozzle comes close to initiating a self-destruct sequence. This will damage you and the Constructs.	0									
313020808	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Humph, are you really be able to recognize each of them? I look forward to your performance.	0									
313020811	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	What? This is...!	0									
313020851	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Wrong. That's a pity. Your Constructs will get hurt if you don't pay more attention.	0									
313020852	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	First Question. Which one is Kamui?	0									
313020853	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Correct, though it's merely a simple one.	0									
313020854	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Second question. Which one is Liv?	0									
313020855	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Correct. As expected, that humility has made it too obvious.	0									
313020856	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Third question. Which one is Bianca?	0									
313020857	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	How does it feel like to be mistaken for Watanabe, your sworn enemy?	0									
313020858	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png	—!	0									
313020859	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	No need to overreact. I've been watching it from the very beginning.	0									
313020860	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Fourth question. Which one is Ayla?	0									
313020861	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	No fun. When she said association, the answer nearly came to the surface.	0									
313020862	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Fifth question. Which one is Chrome?	0									
313020863	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	That said, Chrome appearing in this place really surprised me. I thought he was preparing for the next special mission.	0									
313020864	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Sixth Question. Which one is Lee?	0									
313020865	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Well, as you've excluded all deceptive answers, it's no surprise that you chose the correct one.	0									
313020866	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Why don't you give scythes a shot? You seem to be a great scythe wielder.	0									
313020867	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	After all, nothing is hard for you... Hah.	0									
313020868	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Seventh question. Which one is Karenina... To be honest, I don't want to go on like this either. The rest are all super simple ones.	0									
313020869	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	Uh... Alright alright. Correct. All words coming from this mouth would be censored by the connection system.	0									
313020870	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SuoleiyouNomal01.png	The last question. Which one is Lucia? Press the confirm button <color=#ff6633>now</color> to finish this game.	0

313030103	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Causing troubles instead of killing me, huh... Lucky that you're a Support type.	0

313030105	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Whatever... Keep pretending.	0									
313030106	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	But you can't keep hiding. We have big guys coming.	0									
313030107	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	As expected, they are Attacker Constructs. Very old models though.	0

313030301	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Can I use these leaves?	0									
313030302	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Yeah, they still have a bitter taste, but I guess we don't have a better option.	0									
313030303	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	We need more though. These aren't enough.	0									
313030304	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Corrupted spotted. Let's get rid of them first.	0

313030354	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	I wonder what kind of zongzi Lucia would like?	3									
313030355	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu2.png	Commandant, I think red bean will be a great addition to the zongzi.	3									
313030356	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	The leaves are a bit annoying, but zongzi contain meat and rice, making them a great food.	3

313040313	2	1	System Voice	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Too bad! You failed to answer within the time limit! You must face a forfeit!	0									
313040314	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	The ammo of my Levi-Gun has all become water... Is it because we are in a game?	0									
313040315	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LiyongzhuangNormal01.png	It's a game from the Golden Age. The questions are probably based on the pop culture of that era.	0

313070401	2	1	West General	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	I've been waiting for you, Challengers! I am West General. I will be testing your courage in the face of evil!	0									
313070402	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Courage...?	0									
313070403	2	1	West General	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	Yep. Ahead of you is an abyss littered with traps.	0									
313070404	2	1	West General	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	You just need to do one thing: observe and find a way out!	0									
313070405	2	1	West General	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	Just so we're clear... I'm not like those two you met earlier. My traps are no child's play. Hehe.	0									
313070406	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	What...?	0									
313070407	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Just avoid the traps, and we'll be fine. I trust Commandant's judgment and will follow accordingly.	0									
313070408	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Let's begin, Commandant.	0									
313070409	2	1	West General	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	What... the hell?!	0									
313070410	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	So the key this time... Uh, isn't this Liv?	0									
313070411	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Didn't expect to see a Gray Raven on it.	0									
313070412	2	1	Kuroro	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Not satisfied, huh?	0									
313070413	2	1	Kuroro	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Perhaps I can help.	0									
313070414	2	1	Kuroro	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Ku—ro—ro!	0									
313070415	2	1	Kuroro	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	You did it! I shall illuminate your path forward!	0									
313070501	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Commandant... Something's wrong. My body is...	0									
313070502	2	1	North General	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	"That's because I rigged this place. Anyway, just remember: only one ""tactic"" per person."	0									
313070503	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	In other words, Commandant, each one of us can only use one type of Signal Orbs.	0									
313070504	2	1	North General	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	Allocate your powers properly to beat the challenge. Consider this a test of your leadership, Commandant.	0									
313070505	2	1	North General	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	Uh... How could you still win after I set so many restrictions?!	0									
313070506	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	If it was just you versus me, you might yet stand a chance. But I'm not fighting alone.	0									
313070507	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	I'm with the Gray Raven squad.	0									
313070508	2	1	North General	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LucunNormal01.png	Ughhh!	0									
313070509	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	And so the fourth key bears the portrait of... Nanami.	0									
313070510	2	1	Kuroro	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Long time no see! I take it you still remember me from the previous tests?	0									
313070511	2	1	Kuroro	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Well, I will continue to assist you in this one.	0									
313070512	2	1	Kuroro	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Ku—ro—ro!	0									
313070513	2	1	Kuroro	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	You did it! May you have infinite energy and Skill Orbs!	0

313090303	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Help me take care of those newbies.	0									
313090304	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	That would be better for them.	0

313090306	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	I need two parts to repair it. A portable battery and a receiver.	0									
313090307	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	These Terrapods were supposed to be practice partners for new soldiers...	0									
313090308	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Right, I can find suitable batteries on them.	0									
313090309	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Guess this model will work...	0

313090313	2	1	Construct	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Instructor Karenina...? I'm on sentry duty.	0									
313090314	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Sentry duty... Why weren't you here just now?	0									
313090315	2	1	Construct	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	...I'm sorry, but you can't go through here.	0

313090332	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Hmph, let me see what you're trying to hide.	0									
313090336	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	I knew the receiver was in here. Dammit! Why is the barrier starting on its own?!	0									
313090337	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	Lucky there was backup ID card from the training center.	0

313090374	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	The bottom layer codes of the Terrapod were tampered with. I bet you are going to cheat for the test a few days later!	0

313094007	2	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	A special performance to make ourselves stand out, of course.	0

313094009	2	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	I don't have a partner to perform kungfu with. Let's go with a safer option, lion dance!	0									
313094010	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	We'll need more performers for the lion dance then.	0

313094014	2	1	Hanged Man Foreman	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	My workers can probably do it, but you need to persuade them first.	0

313094333	2	1	Hanged Man Foreman	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	No. My guys all spoke highly of you.	0									
313094334	2	1	Hanged Man Foreman	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	Their opinions matter a lot to me. That alone would make me join your lion dance team.	0									
313094335	2	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadChangyu1.png	Really? Hooray!	0									
313094341	2	1	Hanged Man Foreman	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/DiaorensanxingNormal01.png	I see you have gathered everyone... You know what the final step is, don't you?	0

100125	2	1	Construct Soldier	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	We had nowhere to go, so we set up this temporary comms station.	0									
100126	2	1	Construct Soldier	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	The number of Corrupted here was unusually high, and they were more aggressive.	0									
100127	2	1	Construct Soldier	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	We had never seen anything like this. Our defense collapsed very soon...	0

100131	2	1	Construct Soldier	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	You should be able to find some spare parts in the supply crate over there. They may not be as good as your original ones...	0

100142	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	The Corrupted's only goal is to destroy humans and everything that has human consciousness.	0									
100143	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	They don't need to communicate with each other. Perhaps this is a result of something else other than the Punishing Virus.	0									
100144	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Thank you for your information and contribution. Please recall your consciousness. We'll take over from here.	0									
100145	2	1	Construct Soldier	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	One more thing. Our squad had to abandon some spare parts when we engaged with the Corrupted earlier. Here are the coordinates.	0									
100146	2	1	Construct Soldier	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	There are Levi-Gun core components in there. If you can secure them, then that Support-type Construct over there should be able to hop back into action.	0

100151	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	We have some time for maintenance. Let's quickly do it and move to the next location.	0									
100201	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Great. I can keep fighting now.	0									
100202	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	I'll keep adjusting them. Tell me the parameters that need to be fixed.	0

100209	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	We should be able to find more clues about the enemy.	0									
100210	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Don't worry, we will protect her during this time.	0									
100211	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	You should trust her and have some faith in us too, Commandant.	0									
100212	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Okay. Initializing memory sequences... Rendering simulation image...	0									
100213	2	1	Construct Soldier	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	The Corrupted ahead have all been exterminated.	0									
100214	2	1	Construct Soldier	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	This has been surprisingly easy so far... Quite unlike the reports from those reports.	0									
100215	2	1	Construct Soldier	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Look at those Corrupted. They're just standing there before the graffiti. I don't think they even notice us...	0									
100216	2	1	Construct Soldier	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	It is quite eerie, but other than that, nothing noteworthy.	0

100252	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	This just never ends...	0									
100253	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Did it run away? We've already lost track of it. Not to mention being in this magnetically disruptive mist.	0									
100254	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Not an issue. Our radars might not work, but we should be able to trace the marks on the floor.	0									
100255	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	These, are our tickets.	0									
100301	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	The toy on your waist makes you seem a lot more approachable, Lucia.	0									
100302	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Is that so...?	0									
100303	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	We spent too much time in the shop... Time to get back to our mission.	0									
100304	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Alright.	0									
100305	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	The Corrupted have infiltrated this place too.	0									
100306	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Prepare for battle!	0									
100307	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	I'll support you.	0									
100308	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	...	0									
100309	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Sorry, Commandant... I think I... lost the plushie...	0									
100310	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	I can see its remains on the ground. It was probably damaged in the battle.	0									
100311	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	...	0									
100312	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	The warehouse over there may have some stock left.	0									
100313	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	I... need to get it back...	0									
100314	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Lucia... I'm coming with you!	0									
100315	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	I knew there would be Corrupted here.	0									
100316	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	There's no other way. Let's fight.	0									
100317	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	You look really out of it, Lucia. Are you sure you're okay?	0									
100318	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	I saw frog plushies on the shelf on the way here.	0									
100319	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Bear with me one second... I'll go get it now!	0									
100320	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	I... apologize for what I did just now...	0									
100321	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	I don't know why, but when I saw this plushie, a strange yet familiar feeling welled up within me...	0									
100322	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	And when I realized I lost it, I felt taken by an immense emptiness...	0									
100323	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	A voice spoke to me, telling me to never let go of it...	0									
100324	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	I got the frog plushie back. Here you are...	0									
100325	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	It's fine, we all have things we hold dear. This is the reason why we're here fighting.	0									
100326	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Things we hold dear...	0									
100327	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Lucia...	0									
100328	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	If you're lost, then simply walk forward. Walking forward itself can be meaningful enough.	0									
100329	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	...Thank you, Lee.	0									
100330	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Don't mention it.	0									
100331	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	More Corrupted have entered the building.	0									
100332	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Everyone, prepare for battle!	0									
100333	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	There are a lot of Corrupted in the mall now.	0									
100334	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Let's get out from that door and continue tracking Nozzle.	0									
100401	2	1	Corrupted	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1YeyaMd000001.png	Defend... the leader...	0

100404	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Let's defeat them first before taking care of Nozzle.	0									
100405	2	1	Graffiti Artist	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	My audience... is getting smaller... Pity... Heehee...	0									
100406	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	How annoying.	0									
100407	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Go after it.	0									
100408	2	1	Corrupted	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1YeyaMd000001.png	Uuuurgh—Freedom—To—Machines—	0									
100409	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Hey, are there anymore? Keep fighting and you'll lose all your followers.	0									
100410	2	1	Graffiti Artist	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	...	0									
100411	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	It went silent...	0									
100412	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Defeat the followers.	0									
100413	2	1	Graffiti Artist	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	No more... audience...	0									
100414	2	1	Graffiti Artist	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	No one to appreciate my art... Heehee...	0									
100415	2	1	Graffiti Artist	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	How lonesome it is...	0									
100416	2	1	Graffiti Artist	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	Despicable... humans... Heehee...	0									
100417	2	1	Graffiti Artist	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	This will be my... final creation... Heehee...	0									
100418	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	It's trying to fight and paint at the same time?	0									
100419	2	1	Graffiti Artist	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	If only I could see... the Sage... just one time...	0									
100420	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Let's put an end to it.	0									
100421	2	1	Graffiti Artist	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	My hands... aren't moving now... Can't paint... Heehee...	0									
100422	2	1	Graffiti Artist	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	My life is... at its end too... I don't need to... paint anymore... as well... Heehee...	0									
100423	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Uh-huh. You and your crazy followers are now nothing but history.	0									
100424	2	1	Graffiti Artist	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	No... The seed of revelation... has been planted... and grows among us...	0									
100425	2	1	Graffiti Artist	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	They... do not follow me... I am but a missionary... of the Sage...	0									
100426	2	1	Graffiti Artist	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	We can shed... everything that binds us... and become free...	0									
100427	2	1	Graffiti Artist	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	A new dawn... awaits Machines. Not human... nor Ascnet... but... truly o-ourselves...	0									
1101001	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	I see a lot of graffiti around. Nozzle must have been here.	0									
1101002	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	We should be able to fix the fragmented memory here.	0									
1101003	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Set up a terminal here to project and process the data stream.	0									
1101004	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	"The code name of this technology is ""The Spear Of F.O.S."""	0									
1101005	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	It still has some issues. High energy consumption, poor portability, limited range...	0									
1101006	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	They probably wanted us to use it in this mission to get more real data.	0									
1101007	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	I have confirmed the first location. Lucia, I have changed the visual frequency to your channel.	0									
1101008	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	So that when the data stream appears, your visual module can capture it.	0									
1101009	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	What do I need to do?	0									
1101010	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Eliminate the erroneous data streams to prevent them from interfering with the main one.	0									
1101011	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Basically, you need to wipe out the Corrupted attacking Nozzle.	0									
1101012	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Initiating projection... Lucia, if anything feels wrong at any time, just tell me.	0									
1101013	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Understood. I'm going.	0									
1101014	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Data recorded. Thanks for the hard work.	0									
1101015	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	For a prototype, it went better than I expected.	0									
1101016	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Let's move onto the next location.	0									
1101017	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Initiating projection... Lucia, please.	0									
1101018	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Sure.	0									
1101019	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Is it over?	0									
1101020	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	All done. Speaking of which...	0									
1101021	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	This is a prototype, so the manual has stated some potential abnormal experiences one may encounter.	0									
1101022	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Like dizziness or faintness, for example. Do you feel any of those?	0									
1101023	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Not really.	0									
1101024	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	It'll be a little different this time.	0									
1101025	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Different?	0									
1101026	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	How should I put it... You'll need to simulate the battle of the main data body.	0									
1101027	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	So I'm going to fight it?	0									
1101028	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Yeah. We want you to fight with the reconstructed data body to observe if there is any abnormality.	0									
1101029	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	I'll leave it to you then.	0									
1101030	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Bring it on.	0									
1102001	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Let's reconfirm our mission here.	0									
1102002	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	The data repaired in the center contains timing errors and discrepancies.	0									
1102003	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	So we need to use this area to calibrate the data. Is that so?	0									
1102004	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	You know it very well, Lee.	0									
1102005	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Just like Lee said, we will rely on his computing power to process these graffiti.	0									
1102006	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	If we can reduce the deviation, we'll be able to get the correct memory data.	0									
1102007	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	I'm setting up the visual response frequency...	0									
1102008	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	I've already done it. Actually, I also optimized the switch method.	0									
1102009	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	This way, I don't need to adapt to the machine again. It should be more efficient.	0									
1102010	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Alright... I'll leave it to you then, Lee.	0									
1102011	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Leave it to me.	0									
1102012	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	How's the situation?	0									
1102013	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Thanks to you, I have finished calibrating this part of data.	0									
1102014	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Good. Moving to the next place now.	0									
1102015	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	The projection is ready to commence, Lee.	0									
1102016	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Whenever you're ready.	0									
1102017	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Calibration complete. I knew you could do it.	0									
1102018	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Nothing difficult really.	0									
1102019	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	This time, we have multiple data points to calibrate. It might be a little more challenging.	0									
1102020	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Doesn't matter. Let's go.	0									
1103001	2	1	Tifa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Why aren't you stopping them?!	0									
1103002	2	1	Graffiti Artist	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	Because... they were... just running...	0									
1103003	2	1	Graffiti Artist	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	They didn't... interfere... with my... creation... Hehe...	0									
1103004	2	1	Tifa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	What a foolish machine...	0									
1103005	2	1	Tifa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	But your powers are special. I may consider taking you in. You can become an Ascendant like me.	0									
1103006	2	1	Graffiti Artist	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	I cannot... follow you... Hehe...	0									
1103007	2	1	Graffiti Artist	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	Only the Sagemachina... can... lead us... to a future of our own...	0									
1103008	2	1	Tifa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	Fool, the future of the world belongs to the Ascension-Network... This is just as expected of a machine.	0									
1103009	2	1	Tifa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	If you are not joining me, then die.	0									
1103010	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Reading interrupted.	0									
1103011	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	I'll take care of this.	0									
1103012	2	1	Graffiti Artist	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	You... are... as superficial... as those humans...	0									
1103013	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Is it my turn this time?	0									
1103014	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Bring it on.	0									
1103015	2	1	Graffiti Artist	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XixiNomal01.png	So... tired...	0									
1103016	2	1	Tifa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TifaNomal01.png	What an insignificant prey.	0									
1103017	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Progress has reached 75%.	0									
1103018	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Time to finish it off.	0									
110101	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	I've never seen a machine with such special consciousness...	0									
110102	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Humans have left the Earth too long. We're no longer familiar with what has happened in this world.	0									
110103	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	All we can do is keep striving forward on our own path.	0									
110104	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Roger...	0									
110105	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Liv, we'll need you to access its control system to ensure it will not attack us when we reboot it.	0									
110106	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Ok, leave it to me.	0									
110107	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lee, we're going to collect its scattered Memory Chips. We should be able to access more clues after a reboot.	0									
110108	2	1	Old Artist	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Anthony, thank you for being my hands to help me complete my artwork... I have no more regrets.	0									
110109	2	1	Old Artist	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	My life is about to end. I don't need to paint anymore.	0									
110110	2	1	Anthony	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	No more... painting...	0									
110111	2	1	Anthony	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Then... am I also... useless?	0

110115	2	1	Anthony	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Then... do you... recognize my... works?	0									
110116	2	1	Old Artist	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	To be honest, I don't really understand your works.	0

110118	2	1	Anthony	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Because... I am a... machine?	0									
110119	2	1	Old Artist	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Could be, or could not. In any case, I hope you can keep it up.	0									
110120	2	1	Old Artist	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	You were so happy when making them. There must be someone who can understand you and share your joy in the future.	0									
110121	2	1	Old Artist	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	If you do find someone like that, you must not let them down...	0									
110122	2	1	Old Artist	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Alright, I need to rest now.	0

110339	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Oh, how conceited can you all be?	0									
110340	2	1	Construct Soldier	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Dammit... Open fire!	0									
110341	2	1	Construct Soldier	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Um... Argh! Why are you removing our Inver-Devices? Are you trying to... infect us?	0									
110342	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Infect? You don't deserve that gift. I am leaving you here.	0									
110343	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	See this bomb in my hand? It suits your sad and sorry selves.	0									
110344	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	I will plant it in your body. Then...	0									
110345	2	1	Construct Soldier	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Wait, what! What are you doing!?	0									
110346	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	When your teammates come for you... they will join you in becoming...	0									
110347	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Hideous fireworks.	0									
110348	2	1	Construct Soldier	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Argh... Gosh... Why... Why...	0									
110349	2	1	Construct Soldier	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Why did I... even fight...	0									
110350	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Phew... Finally got here.	0									
110351	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Hmm? Why is there no one around?	0									
110352	2	1	Estate Butler	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Greetings... You should just stay here forever.	0									
110353	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	The normal route leads people to this fake hall...	0									
110354	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	To enter the real guest hall, we must take a special route.	0									
110355	2	1	Estate Butler	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	I locked up all those Corrupted that the Estate could not destroy inside this room.	0									
110356	2	1	Estate Butler	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	If those people are going to use you, I would rather you get consumed by the Corrupted...	0									
110357	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Did he purposely separate us?	0									
110358	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	What a waste of effort. I've already found you.	0									
110359	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	That voice sounds so familiar...	0									
110360	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Hey, butler. Did something happen over there?	0									
110361	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	He's not answering. Let's find a way out first.	0									
110362	2	1	Estate Butler	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	I will stop you right here.	0									
110363	2	1	Estate Butler	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	I must protect... Mr. Copperfield's... lifelong work...	0									
110364	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	……	0									
110365	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Thanks for all the joy you brought me today, Mr. Butler.	0									
110366	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	I'm very sorry... But I must let Punishing Virus infect you.	0									
110367	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	It's all for Miss Luna.	0									
110368	2	1	Estate Butler	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	I will... never yield!	0									
110369	2	1	Estate Butler	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Ugh... Aaargh!	0									
110370	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Commandant... We have reached another zone corrupted by Punishing Virus.	0									
110371	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	We must remove the illusions first... Commandant, help us break through the obstacles!	0									
110372	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	The Virus is gone! Commandant, let's continue to read the record...	0									
110374	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Commandant... We have reached another zone corrupted by Punishing Virus.	0									
110375	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	We must remove the illusions first... Commandant, help us break through the obstacles!	0									
110376	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	The Virus is gone! Commandant, let's continue to read the record...	0									
110401	2	1	Zack	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Corrupted incoming... Emma... lost... Must... protect... Emma...	0									
110402	2	1	Zack	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Go away...	0									
110403	2	1	Zack	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Must... find... Emma...	0									
110404	2	1	Zack	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Go away!	0									
110405	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Commandant, I need to scan Zack's memory shell before attempting to repair him.	0									
110406	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	The structure of the memory shell is simple, but for some reason, it isn't deeply infected.	0									
110407	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Let's investigate together.	0									
110408	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	"The tag of the important record is ""Operation Grand Retreat""."	0									
110409	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Punishing Virus has infested these data zones. The virus illusions are impacting our data query.	0									
110410	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	I've made some progress. All related data found. Loading now.	0									
110411	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	I just need to repair one more section to start reading Zack's memories.	0									
110412	2	1	Zack	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Clues of... Emma's lost items...	0									
110413	2	1	Zack	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Find Emma... Items...	0									
110414	2	1	Zack	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Find Emma... Items...	0									
110415	2	1	Zack	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Calculating... Completed... West halls...	0									
110416	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Large-scale data corruption here. Leave it to me.	0									
110417	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	At the end of the Post-Pandemic Age, Corrupted controlled by the Punishing Virus already had military production capabilities.	0									
110418	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Even with the comprehensive defense of this Estate Museum, it could not hold against the overwhelming number of Corrupted.	0									
110419	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	That was the situation they had to face.	0									
110420	2	1	Zack	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AnbaoNomal01.png	Zack... help... Emma and Copperfield... retreat...	0									
110421	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	We've reached the deepest part of the data. The record shows Zack was already being infected at that time.	0									
110422	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	But somehow the infection was restricted and controlled at a certain level.	0									
110423	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Let's clear the virus illusions here and read the final record.	0									
110424	2	1	Estate Butler	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Zack... We are the only ones left here.	0									
110425	2	1	Estate Butler	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	I will take you to the Static Lock. I hope Mr. Copperfield's research will work.	0									
110426	2	1	Estate Butler	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BalaswordNomal.png	Before that, I just need to calm you down... I never thought we would end up like this.	0									
110601	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Recreating memory now. Hope we can find clues of the Ascendant.	0									
110602	2	1	Corrupted	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyongganrantiNomal01.png	—! —!	0									
110603	2	1	Sister	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Punishing Virus injection complete... All weapon system activated... Increasing power output...	0									
110604	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Wait, why is she using the power of Punishing Virus, but still seen as an enemy by Corrupted?	0									
110605	2	1	Sister	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	I haven't fought for a long time. Looks like... this will be my last fight.	0									
110606	2	1	Sister	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Gargh. This power still impacts my mind... In the end, it still tests my faith...	0									
110607	2	1	Sister	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Tsk. I thought that God bloke abandoned me long ago...	0									
110608	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	There are way too many Corrupted. Commandant, we should retreat now!	0									
110609	2	1	Sister	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	I should continue... with my final cleansing...	0									
110610	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Simulation in progress. Commandant, please watch closely!	0									
110611	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Even in this time, her frame capabilities are as good as ours in battle.	0									
110612	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	But we have no information at all... I wonder how many secrets did the Church have in the past?	0									
110613	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	All those Corrupted came from the machine factory's direction.	0									
110614	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	If the source remains, their numbers would only keep growing... Exactly like what happened to us.	0									
110615	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	The Sister's destination... seems to be right there.	0									
110616	2	1	Sister	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Phew, just like those little brats... You always look down on adults.	0									
110617	2	1	Sister	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Do you know how difficult it is to be an adult...? Get out of my way!	0									
110618	2	1	Sister	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	……	0									
110619	2	1	Sister	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Tsk.	0									
110620	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	The Punishing Virus' impact must have peaked around this point.	0									
110621	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	These are... the large firefighting robots we met before...	0									
110622	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Yet, Punishing Virus modified them into arsonists. How ironic.	0									
110623	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Data interfered by virus illusions...	0									
110624	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Wait a sec. I'm activating emergency mode.	0									
110625	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Okay. We've seen it many times. We know what to do.	0									
110626	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Virus interference removed. Re-syncing now.	0									
110627	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Ah, the virus infection is rooted deeply here... It needs a deep cleaning. I'll need help.	0									
110628	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	She managed to... hold off so many Corrupted here...	0									
110629	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	As if she had an endless reserve of energy... Was it because of the Punishing Virus, or her own obsession?	0									
110630	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Commandant, it's a new combat objective!	0									
110631	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	This piece of broken memory probably came from when Sister was hunted by Nozzle.	0									
110632	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	We need to manually repair the noise while tracing the memory.	0									
110633	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Recording complete. So this is when Sister met Nozzle.	0									
110634	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Next section... Okay, done.	0									
110635	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	After ascension, even Nozzle could use tactics against its enemy.	0									
110636	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	The final section is also recorded.	0									
110637	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	There were just too many Corrupted. Even Sister had no choice but to run.	0									
110638	2	1	Sister	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	This is the factory's core...	0									
110639	2	1	Sister	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/XiunvNomal01.png	Why would humans design such a fragile structure... Once it's destroyed, everything will be lost. How unreliable.	0									
110640	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	The memory data shows that Sister had already reached her infection limit.	0									
110641	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	But she hadn't completed her objective yet...	0									
110642	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Let's finish this journey with her.	0									
110643	1	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	All missions in the current stage have been completed. Go to the memory breakpoint to start the next stage.	3									
110644	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	This piece of memory is already close to the end.	0									
110645	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	...This should be Sister's final struggle.	0									
110646	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Let's go get her final memory.	0									
110647	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Commandant... We have reached another zone corrupted by Punishing Virus.	0									
110648	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	We must remove the illusions first... Commandant, help us break through the obstacles!	0									
110649	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	The Virus is gone! Commandant, let's continue to read the record...	0									
117010101	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	The memory data videos show that Rohacchi found some spark falling into the ruins.	0									
117010102	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	And it became very interested in it.	0									
117010103	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	It then traced all the way toward the spark's landing point.	0									
117010104	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	It seemed to have also activated some mechanism within the ruins...	0									
117010105	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	To further analyze the videos in this memory data...	0									
117010106	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	I will recreate the situation by video.	0									
117010107	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	The memory is completely restored. Rohacchi opened this switch to move to a higher level.	3									
117010108	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	The sealed road opened again.	3									
117010201	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	"On its journey, Rohacchi ran into the source of the spark and noises... and got attacked by ""Roseblade""."	0									
117010202	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	"As expected, all the suddenly appeared Constructs were related to Ascendants. They were also after ""Tenebrion""."	0									
117010203	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	"Commandant, I suggest we carefully study the combat data against ""Roseblade"". It will benefit our subsequent operations."	0									
117010301	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Rohacchi seemed to have met similar-looking machines.	0									
117010302	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	It thought they were its own kind and went up to them.	0									
117010303	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Only to be met with sudden assault.	0									
117010304	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Subsequent memory data has been deciphered. Transforming to digital video now.	0									
117010305	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	"In the memory, IX-68 squatted next to one of its ""kin,"" slowly patting its body..."	0									
117010401	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Here, Rohacchi met Nanami...	0									
117010402	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	And suddenly attacked...!?	0									
117010403	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Perhaps we could find more information about Nanami from this memory.	0									
117010404	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	The battle didn't last long, and Nanami seemed to have moved together with Rohacchi for some time.	0									
117010501	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	According to the memory, Rohacchi and Nanami defeated many Corrupted and returned to the upper level of the ruins.	0									
117010502	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	"Looks like the ""mural"" they were talking about must be nearby."	0									
117010503	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	"I'll continue with my analysis, Commandant. Please look out for any info related to the ""mural"" that caused them to awaken."	0									
117010601	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	According to Rohacchi's memory, this should be where they first saw the mural.	0									
117010602	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	But when it took Nanami there, they found nothing.	0									
117010603	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Apart from those machines wandering nearby.	0									
117010604	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Maybe the ruins collapsed because of us, so the murals also fell to another location.	0									
117010605	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	No matter what, this piece of memory is worth studying again.	0									
118010101	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	I found well-preserved facilities underneath the ruins.	0									
118010102	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	I tried my best to stay awake.	0									
118010103	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	But I knew I didn't have much time left.	0									
118010104	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	So I had to break away from the Corrupted ASAP.	0									
118010201	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	One after another. Aren't you tired at all??	0									
118010202	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Why don't you just come all together? At least it can save some time.	0									
118010203	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	I must keep moving. No one can stop me.	0									
118010301	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	At the bottom of the ruins, I found a long and narrow corridor. Unlike the upper levels, the facilities there were kept very well.	0									
118010302	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	But I was exhausted from non-stop fighting.	0									
118010303	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Those Corrupted seemed to have noticed this too, and launched an assault together.	0									
118010401	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Tsk, the number just keeps growing...	0

118010403	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	I know what you're planning. I'm not done yet!	0									
118010404	2	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuNomal01.png	Hah, you bluff. I know full well about your body.	0									
118010405	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	...I will never let the virus infect me.	0									
118010501	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKalienina1.png	You, stop right there!	0									
118010502	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	I was shocked to hear such a loud voice. Never thought she would catch up so quickly.	0									
118010503	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	And thanks to her, all the wandering Corrupted came up to us. The only thought I had was to never let them get me.	0									
118010601	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	After getting rid of all the annoying Corrupted, Camu launched his final attack too.	0									
118010602	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	He was far more powerful than me. I knew about that. All too well.	0									
118010603	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	But I had my reasons to fight too...	0									
118010604	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Of course I would not fall so easily! Because I must be myself!	0

311010110	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Oh really.	0									
311010111	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Don't you know? We noticed that your coordinates were moving through the Pacific Ocean over the last week...	0									
311010112	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	So what's going on with you?	0									
311010113	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	I'm on the back of a Narwhal.	0

311010115	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	I've already controlled its diving module. Maybe three more days...	0

311010119	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	I remember... You started from the coastal areas of South America. Did you find it over there?	0									
311010120	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Yes.	0									
311010121	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	You really are into weird things like this, aren't you...	0									
311010122	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	It probably has a consciousness that is highly identical to a human's. I find it very interesting.	0									
311010123	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	The fact that it was attacked by the Corrupted proves this.	0

311010125	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuolanNomal01.png	Yes?	0									
311010126	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	The view was great there.	0

311010128	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	I'm going to focus on dealing with the Corrupted. They are interfering with my control over the Narwhal.	0

311010131	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	The communication signal is lost... I must prevent the virus infection and restore the communication...	0

311010510	2	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LuosaitaNormal01.png	In the sea...? A raging tide?!	0

311010702	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	If you call that a battle.	0									
311010703	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	You are not even half as good as her.	0									
311010704	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Do you even understand what you have done...?	0									
311010705	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	You are my enemy, and I'm going to defeat you. This will never change!	0

311010707	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	I made her an Ascendant in order to save her.	0									
311010708	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	But because of what you did...	0									
311010709	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	She will become a mindless puppet controlled by the Punishing Virus instead.	0									
311010710	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	Ugh...!	0									
311010711	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	But so what...? Both the Corrupted and the so-called Ascendants are the enemy of humans.	0									
311010712	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Is that so... Whatever.	0									
311010713	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Just stay there and watch. This is the difference between us.	0									
311010714	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	Why am I... drawn to her...	0									
311010801	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Hmph. Even as a puppet...	0									
311010802	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	You still know who's the strong one...	0									
311010803	2	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png	Let's end it then.	0									
309010101	2	1	Diana	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	It's been a while since I last came here.	0									
309010102	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	What is this place, Diana...?	0									
309010103	2	1	Diana	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	During the early outbreak of the Punishing Virus, Murmansk had enjoyed a period of prosperity thanks to its geographical advantages.	0									
309010104	2	1	Diana	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	It absorbed many inland cities and formed a commonwealth. This place was part of the northeast commonwealth.	0									
309010105	2	1	Diana	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	And one of the birthplaces of Forest Guard.	0									
309010106	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	There's no time for nostalgia... We are followed.	0									
309010107	2	1	Diana	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Smells like a prey...	0									
309010108	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Forest Guards, continue tracing forward. Stay close to the target...	0									
309010109	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Gray Raven will bring up the rear and deal with the enemies in the shadows!	0									
309010201	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	The target is not far ahead, but why didn't you ask the Forest Guard to follow up?	0									
309010202	2	1	Diana	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	You said Evan was on his feet. There's no way he could lose the Corrupted.	0									
309010203	2	1	Diana	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	But we didn't see him when we locked on to the target...	0									
309010204	2	1	Diana	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Something's not right.	0									
309010205	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Our target is running away!	0									
309010206	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Hesitation will only lead to failure. Go! Stop it!	0									
309010301	2	1	Diana	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Evan can't just disappear!	0									
309010302	2	1	Diana	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	There must be other clues nearby. Forest Guards! Spread out!	0									
309010303	2	1	Diana	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Search everywhere! Everywhere!	0									
309010304	2	1	Diana	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Someone found a 5cm long, shattered titanium plate...	0									
309010305	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Please let me take a look!	0									
309010306	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	...Yes! There's human sebum and hair on the edges.	0									
309010307	2	1	Diana	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	That's our first clue! We are on the right track!	0									
309010308	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Looking for clues help, but the longer we stay here, the easier we may become the target instead...	0									
309010309	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Lee, are you talking about the wandering Corrupted in the forest?	0									
309010310	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Not just the forest. They could also be among the snowy rocks, even river beds.	0									
309010311	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Commandant! Please stay alerted!	0									
309010312	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	I'm about to process the human pheromones found on these parts...	0									
309010313	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Diana, please give me Evan's weapon. I need to collect his pheromones.	0									
309010314	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	The two samples matched perfectly! Evan was here! Now I can make a pheromone detector.	0									
309010315	2	1	Diana	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Is that...?	0									
309010316	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	As long as Evan is still breathing, we can detect the pheromone he produces.	0									
309010317	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Found him!!	0									
309010318	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	He's trapped on the shell of the Corrupted. Why...? Are they using him to protect themselves?	0									
309010319	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Adjust your equipment immediately! Only melee weapons are allowed. We must not hurt humans!	0									
309010401	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	I can't cut through these metal bones without hurting the rescue target.	0									
309010402	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Our only option is to make a strategic relocation. Take it back to the Forest Guard stronghold first, then we can think of another way.	0									
309010403	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lee... How's his health doing?	0									
309010404	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Don't worry, he's not infected. Just a little hypothermia.	0									
309010405	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Strong Punishing reaction detected nearby! Everyone, watch out!	0									
309010406	2	1	Diana	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	The Corrupted are still killing.	0									
309010407	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Diana, please join us and form a line of defense together.	0									
309010408	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	We must not let Corrupted hurt humans.	0									
309010501	2	1	Diana	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	The Forest Guard acknowledges Liv's strategic vision.	0									
309010502	2	1	Diana	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	My sisters and I will do all we can to assist Gray Raven's rescue plan.	0									
309010503	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Calculations complete. The enemy's weak points are its supporting legs.	0									
309010504	2	1	Diana	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/IceguideNormal01.png	Sisters! Focus fire on the supporting legs!	0									
309010505	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Wait a sec. Mr. Lee didn't include Evan in his calculation...	0									
309010506	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Some of those legs are very close to Evan's location.	0									
309010507	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Please, everyone, don't hurt Evan.	0									
10099001	1	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	That cross-shaped terminal is causing EM polarization on the other devices.	4									
10099002	1	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	The affected devices are nigh-immune to most of our attacks.	4									
10099003	1	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Attack the cross-shaped terminal continuously to remove this status from them.	6									
10099004	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	The light beams radiating from the Heteromer Terminal will repair the Heteromer devices.	5									
10099005	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	But be careful, these beams contain viruses that will cause stress to our sensory systems if we get hit directly.	6									
10099006	1	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Commandant of Gray Raven, these oddly shaped terminals have the ability to split apart.	5									
10099007	1	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	The polar electric current circulating between them can paralyze a Construct's sensory and reduce its mobility.	5									
10099008	1	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	But consecutive attacks can reverse their polarity.	4									
10099009	1	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Consider this option if they appear in this form.	4									
10090101	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	According to the map, we've managed to land at the designated location—	0									
10090102	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	The data analysis cabin on the space station.	0									
10090103	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	But... nothing's left of our aircraft...	0									
10090104	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	If we can destroy the space station's defense system, then we should be able to retreat when the main forces arrive.	0									
10090105	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	These terminals give me the creeps...	0									
10090106	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Is this what the report was talking about? The strange corruption phenomenon localized only in this space station?	0									
10090107	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Be careful, Lee.	0									
10090108	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	This is...!	0									
10090109	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	We managed to unlock a higher clearance level...	0									
10090110	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Wait, that cross just now is guarding the exit now...	0									
10090111	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	According to my preliminary scanning results, this type of enemy is not made of any known conventional machinery...	0									
10090112	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	It is... composed entirely of the Punishing Virus...	0									
10090113	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	This space station really IS hiding some important secrets...	0									
10090114	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Looks like we can't just simply blow this place up.	0									
10090115	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Guys, I've turned off the space station's sensor systems.	0									
10090116	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Well done, Liv.	0									
10090117	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	This should help relieve some pressure for Babylonia.	0									
10090118	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Yep, our first step to victory.	0									
10090201	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	We have arrived at the second target location.	0									
10090202	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	According to the analysis, this should be the weapons control backend...	0									
10090203	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	...after being corrupted and modified by the virus.	0									
10090204	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	A lot of inactive Heteromers in here...	0									
10090205	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	If they all turn hostile like what happened just now...	0									
10090206	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Do you see that cross-shaped enemy in the middle?	0									
10090207	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	We're unsure how it manages to...	0									
10090208	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	...But it seems like this type of enemy can create enemies, and not to mention that it—	0									
10090209	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Holds the key to solving our problems, I know...	0									
10090210	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Those black pillars... decompose... and reconstruct...	0									
10090211	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Every bit of Hetero-matter of the Punishing Virus in this space station could become our enemy...	0									
10090212	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Our attacks can deactivate them, at least temporarily.	0									
10090213	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	As long as it works, right?	0									
10090214	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Yep, let's deal with them like this for now.	0									
10090215	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Finally...	0									
10090216	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Ah... Some Hetero-matter have regenerated and are moving again!	0									
10090217	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Tch, we're not really in a position to play attrition warfare here...	0									
10090218	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Liv, access the control system directly. Lee—	0									
10090219	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Got it.	0									
10090220	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Done!	0									
10090221	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	All close-range defense systems for interception purposes are offline!	0									
10090222	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Well done, Liv.	0									
10090223	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	The subsequent forces have begun issuing boarding signals.	0									
10090224	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	We won't have to fight on our own anymore.	0									
10090301	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	But, you do look like you're in some sort of trouble.	0									
10090302	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Let's skip the small talk.	0									
10090303	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Consider this my little present.	0									
10090304	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	The enemies just now displayed a completely different mode of attack.	0									
10090305	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	But Watanabe's already figured out how to deal with them...	0									
10090306	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Such strength...	0									
10090307	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	He feels like a different person.	0									
10090308	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	So, is everything fine?	0									
10090309	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	……	0									
10090310	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Oh, it's all thanks to you, Mr. Watanabe.	0									
10090311	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Hah, spunky as ever.	0									
10090401	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	...This place looks different from the others.	0									
10090402	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	The door is encrypted. Your specialty, Lee.	0									
10090403	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	(Analyzing...)	0									
10090404	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	I... see...	0									
10090405	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	There's four corrupted terminals in the four corners of this compartment.	0									
10090406	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Varied combinations can be produced by activating them...	0									
10090407	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Let's try different combinations.	0									
10090408	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Door's cracked, but the Heteromers have entered defense mode...	0									
10090409	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Well, progress. At least.	0									
10090410	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Let's finish off the remaining enemies.	0									
10090411	1	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Levels, huh? The mysterious blocks on the terminal might be the key.	3									
10090412	1	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	It appears that interacting with the terminal can change the shape of the block...	3									
10090413	1	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Looks like we have to choose a shape...	3									
10090414	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Maybe something will happen if we leave a certain number of blocks in the corresponding shapes.	3									
10090501	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Lucia... She's all pumped up all of a sudden...	0									
10090502	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	I see. It's a challenge, isn't it? Hah...	0									
10090503	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	All right, I'll accept it—Let's see who can sweep the enemies faster.	0									
10090504	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	How's that? Still got it in me, eh?	0									
10090505	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	...Impressive.	0									
10090506	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Let's work together to protect Liv from the last wave of attacks.	0									
10090507	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	On it.	0									
10090508	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Is this what I'm looking for...?	0									
10090509	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	What did you say, Watanabe?	0									
10090510	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Nothing.	0									
10090601	2	1	Korolev	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TieqiuNomal01.png	You... did not comply with... the regulations...	0									
10090602	2	1	Korolev	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TieqiuNomal01.png	Now... Children... Please kindly follow Korolev to the confinement cabin...	0									
10090603	2	1	Korolev	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TieqiuNomal01.png	Accept your punishment...	0									
10090604	2	1	Korolev	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TieqiuNomal01.png	If any resistance occurs... Korolev will follow the rules... to adopt the minimum enforcement measures...	0									
10090605	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Liv, that... is...?	0									
10090606	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	It's not composed of Hetero-matter. It's a real Corrupted... I'm afraid...	0									
10090607	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	It's that Kamui incarnate that's been broadcasting the whole time?	0									
10090608	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	But, in such a high viral density environment... Can a machine truly maintain its original mind?	0									
10090609	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	It feels like... it's being held in captivity alone in here... What could be the reason for that...?	0									
10090610	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	We might never find the answers... All I know now is that we only have one option...	0									
10090611	2	1	Korolev	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TieqiuNomal01.png	Confinement...	0									
10090701	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Gravity is starting to act up around here...	0									
10090702	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	The core of the space station... The gravity room. We finally made it.	0									
10090703	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	It's the gravity experiment here that gave birth to Hetero-matter—	0									
10090704	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Who would have thought—Humans aren't just suffering from the Punishing Virus, they even gave it new life...	0									
10090705	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Watanabe... Thank you for fighting with us all this way...	0									
10090706	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Don't worry, I won't leave until the threat of this space station is resolved.	0									
10090707	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	I know those enemies were just warm-up for you.	0									
10090708	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Now, let's show them what we can do.	0									
10090709	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Those crosses... again...	0									
10090710	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	It's like their presence is conveying a certain message...	0									
10090711	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Commandant, we can't go any further...	0									
10090712	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	This is an artificially designed area. Now that we've dispatched the enemies—	0									
10090713	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	The mechanism should be returning to normal.	0									
10090714	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Try to get closer to the edge.	0									
10090715	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	What a stunning design...	0									
10090716	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	This can only be achieved by precise gravity manipulation...	0									
10090717	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	If I recall, there's gravity generators inside Babylonia as well, no?	0									
10090718	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Yes... But I never thought I would come so close to its prototype...	0									
10090719	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	I've just tested its integrity. It should be good to go—	0									
10090720	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Let's advance!	0									
10090721	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	This is...	0									
10090722	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Some kind of mechanism again... Guess we can't skip past it.	0									
10090723	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Ah, it's a device used to lock those rings.	0									
10090724	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Looks like it's used to stabilize the rings and gravity core.	0									
10090725	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Those rings should function in a similar way. Let's go.	0									
10090726	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Yeah...	0									
10090801	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	I'm not sure what would happen if you mess up...	0									
10090802	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	But please follow my instructions.	0									
10090803	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	The first message is—	0									
10090804	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	From two to one.	0									
10090805	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Do you have any ideas?	0									
10090806	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	It seems to be related to these light beams...	0									
10090807	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	I'll try to brute-force it, but it's going to take some time.	0									
10090808	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	And it might trigger high alert. Anyway, let's get through this together, Commandant.	0									
10090809	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	It worked.	0									
10090810	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Miss Ayla, please provide the next instruction!	0									
10090811	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Okay, the next message is—	0									
10090812	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	From abstract to concrete.	0									
10090813	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Abstract and concrete... We've encountered enemies like that before.	0									
10090814	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	"Which means... ""Starting from the abstract""?"	0									
10090815	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Let's do it then!	0									
10090816	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	We can move on now!	0									
10090817	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	The path is blocked off again.	0									
10090818	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	As you can see... There's three movable mechanisms...	0									
10090819	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	We do!	0									
10090820	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	According to the record, the tip here is—	0									
10090821	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	The beginning is the end.	0									
10090822	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Hmm, I think I kind of get it...	0									
10090823	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Same as before, I'll try to crack it forcibly.	0									
10090824	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	As expected, you solved the puzzle first, Commandant.	0									
10090825	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Ah, here we're again...	0									
10090826	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	It should be the last mechanism for this ring.	0									
10090827	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Please tell us the last tip.	0									
10090828	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Okay, listen carefully—	0									
10090829	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Disarray is unity.	0									
10090830	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	This is even more cryptic...	0									
10090831	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	But experience tells us that we have to create a certain pattern using these light beams.	0									
10090832	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Although I'm not quite certain about it, I think we might want to create as many divisions and chaos as we can with the beams.	0									
10090833	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Backend hacking is also in progress.	0									
10090834	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	I think... We got it?	0									
10090835	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Yep, well done!	0									
10090836	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	……	0									
10090837	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	The control mechanism for the next ring has appeared.	0									
10090838	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Let's continue.	0									
10090839	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Only a few rings left.	0									
10090840	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Yeah, we'd better hurry. Other troops should be on their way now.	0									
10090841	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	No matter what enemy awaits...	0									
10090842	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	This time, we have countless teammates on our side.	0									
10090843	1	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Hmm... maybe it's implying that we have to create a certain pattern.	3									
10090844	1	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Two into... Maybe it's something about the number of light beams.	3									
10090845	1	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	One might mean a circle, but what does it have to do with the tip?	3									
10090846	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Two paths, a single line. I feel like we're nearing the answer.	3									
10090847	1	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Is it meant to be taken literally...?	3									
10090848	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	If the lines that are crossed becomes connected instead... I guess?	3									
10090849	1	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	A ring structure...? Could it be a clue to solving this puzzle?	3									
10090850	1	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Having the beams circulate should match the tip...	3									
10090851	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Connecting it in another way might be worth a try...	3									
10090852	1	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Maybe we should make the straight lines at the beginning into something else?	3									
10090853	1	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Light beams... Prism... Three points... Perhaps we can indeed change something...	3									
10090854	1	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Make the single... No, the two merged light beams split. Perhaps... Maybe...	3									
10090855	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Commandant, I will hack into it from the backend now.	3									
10090901	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	The enemies here look different...	0									
10090902	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	They didn't decomposed upon being defeated. Instead—	0									
10090903	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	They entered into a state similar to hibernation... Their energy flow is stable inside their remains...	0									
10090904	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	No more paths forming ahead. Might be because of these enemies.	0									
10090905	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Commandant, I don't know what you make of it, but we'd better act with caution.	0									
10090906	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	After all, this is a new variant from the ones we've been dealing with.	0									
10090907	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Wait... Are they... gathering around us?	0									
10090908	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	They aren't displaying aggression somehow...	0									
10090909	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Nonsense.	0									
10090910	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Unless...	0									
10090911	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	What's on your mind, Watanabe?	0									
10090912	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	……	0									
10090913	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	I'll speak for him—Unless the virus chooses to.	0									
10090914	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	The virus chooses to? You mean the Punishing Virus is able to make a choice?	0									
10090915	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	That's a sign of intelligence, but...	0									
10090916	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	I don't know... I'm afraid no one knows why, frankly.	0									
10090917	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Well... It's not like we have many options now.	0									
10090918	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	A path is made... The energy inside these enemies are transferred to the mechanism...	0									
10090919	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	And also flowing towards the gravity core.	0									
10090920	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1SS.png	Sounds just like a recipe for disaster.	0									
10090921	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	That core is the primary target of this operation.	0									
10090922	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	At the very least... We're getting closer to our final target.	0									
10090923	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	No more new enemies, Lucia.	0									
10090924	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Then, this should be the final mechanism.	0									
10090925	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	After passing through here, we'll be facing the largest Heteromer that is mooching off on the gravity core.	0									
10090926	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Hesitation will only lead to our defeat at this point.	0									
10090927	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	...Gray Raven, prepare for battle!	0									
30150101	2	1	Construct	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Mr. Lee truly never misses a shot!	0									
30150102	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	I won't waste a single bullet.	0									
30150103	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Mission complete. Prepare to retreat. Commandant should be waiting for us outside here.	0									
30150104	2	1	Construct A	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Mr. Lee, it seems we've been going round in circles...	0

30150106	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	This way.	0									
30150107	2	1	Construct B	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Hey, I heard Mr. Lee has no sense of direction. It isn't true, is it? (Softly)	0									
30150108	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Remaining Heteromers discovered ahead. Everyone, ready to engage.	0									
30150109	2	1	Constructs	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Roger!	0									
30150110	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Commandant, we've arrived at the designated location. Nearby devices show apparent traces of being tampered by Gabriel.	0									
30150111	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	All devices are expected to be recovered in five minutes.	0									
30150112	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	"After this, Engineering Force can ""touch down"" on the space station and carry out their duties..."	0									
30150113	2	1	Construct	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Mr. Lee! Nearby devices have returned to operation all of a sudden!	0									
30150114	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Tsk, what a tedious parting gift.	0									
309030701	2	1	Tiger	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Meo—I mean, Grrrrr...! The Tiger's got some goodies for you!	0

309030703	2	1	Rat	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Wait a sec! Why are they beating up my bro?	0									
309030704	2	1	Rat	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Whatever...! The goodies are delivered, squeak—!	0									
11100101	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	High concentration of Punishing Virus detected! The Corrupted are swarming in—	0									
11100102	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	I'm here to help. Please continue the rescue and evacuation.	0									
11100103	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	I'll do my best!	0									
11100104	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	I'll handle the Corrupted on the other side with Lee.	0									
11100105	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Understood.	0									
11100106	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	All people have been evacuated, and some of the wounded have received emergency treatment.	0									
11100107	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Thank you...	0									
11100201	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Be careful. Those two Corrupted's energy reactions are abnormal.	0									
11100202	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Stay alert. They might be hiding nearby.	0									
11100203	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	I'll take care of them. You take the opportunity to break through the passage.	0									
11100204	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Okay, then we'll destroy the Corrupted lurking there.	0									
11100205	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Please be careful, Sophia.	0									
11100206	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Got it...	0									
11100207	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	The battle is over.	0									
11100208	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	The passage is clear!	0									
11100209	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	It's clear, Sophia!	0									
11100210	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Understood. I'm coming now.	0									
11100301	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Please be careful, Sophia!	0									
11100302	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	The signals show that they are the machines used for train maintenance.	0									
11100303	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Watch out for their special attacks.	0									
11100304	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	It's all cleared.	0									
11100305	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Let's meet up with them now. Changyu's there too.	0									
11100401	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	It's shell is hard to break. Liv, can you identify its weaknesses?	0									
11100402	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	I'm trying!	0									
11100403	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	We can't go on like this.	0									
11100404	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Gray Raven is fighting the Core's Heteromers.	0									
11100405	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Fend off the Corrupted. Ensure they won't bring any trouble to us.	0									
11100406	2	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	...I'll take care of the ones behind us.	0									
11100407	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	If you push yourself too far, I'll stop you no matter what.	0									
11100408	2	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	Don't sweat it. I have a plan.	0									
11100409	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	All cleared. Changyu, what's the situation on your end?	0									
11100410	2	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	……	0									
11100411	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Changyu?	0									
11100501	2	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	Sorry... I've dragged you down...	0									
11100502	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Then save your breath. I have to deal with your wounds first.	0									
11100503	2	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	...Roger that.	0									
11100504	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	This way leads back to the carriage.	0									
11100505	2	1	Rail Heterozygote	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	——	0									
11100506	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	I'll be back right away.	0									
11100601	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	I'll help you collect the parts.	0									
11100602	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Please be careful, Sophia...	0									
11100603	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	I'll be careful...	0									
11100604	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	That's enough.	0									
11100605	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Half of the Corrupted have been destroyed. This area is safe for now.	0									
10100101	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	High concentration of Punishing Virus detected! It's...	0									
10100102	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	A hideous appearance indeed.	0									
10100103	2	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SailikaNomal01.png	Can you hear me, Gray Ravens? I've detected that you've successfully landed on the train.	0									
10100104	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	...And we are now facing the target.	0									
10100105	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Lee, what do you mean?	0									
10100106	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	The Hetero-Core has been highly corrupted and mutated when falling to Earth. The target we've been after is right before us.	0									
10100107	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Permission for engagement, Commandant.	0									
10100108	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	The Heterozygote's claws seem super dangerous.	0									
10100109	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Perhaps we can entice it to attack us, then we have a chance to destroy its claws.	0									
10100110	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	It's not working. Our attacks hardly deal any damage to it.	0									
10100111	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Watch out, it isn't finished yet.	0									
10100201	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	This train is...?	0									
10100202	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Focus. The enemies aren't finished yet.	0									
10100203	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Punishing concentration continues to surge... It's corrupting the new train!	0									
10100204	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Liv, bring sufficient serum. We'll go after it.	0									
10100205	2	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	Hey, you're not here to make the deal, are you?	0									
10100206	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	What are you talking about?	0									
10100207	2	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	If it stops here, Lord Jamilah's plan will be disrupted. It's time to act, Sophia!	0									
10100208	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	...Understood. Then push it to the front.	0									
10100209	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Who are these...?	0									
10100210	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	The sandstorm has disrupted our visual system and the number of Corrupted is increasing. They will hinder our pursuit.	0									
10100211	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Commandant, I propose that we adjust the operation, passing through inside the train to intercept our target.	0									
10100212	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Glass cupola...	0									
10100213	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Perhaps we can go inside the train through the cupola.	0									
10100214	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	At this rate, the train will enter the area ravaged by sandstorm... We'll be forced to abandon the pursuit.	0									
10100215	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	But if we don't deal with it right now, this train will be the next victim...	0									
10100301	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Those mechanoids are... attacking each other?	0									
10100302	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	The signals show that they are the machines used for train maintenance.	0									
10100303	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	...It seems that the uncorrupted mechanoids are defending against the corrupted ones.	0									
10100304	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	I'll help.	0									
10100305	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	You're here too, Sophia.	0									
10100306	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	In order to evacuate the people, we have to intercept the Heterozygote formed by core mutation.	0									
10100307	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	This way!	0									
10100308	2	1	Commoner	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	That is the aristocrats' carriage. If we enter without permission...	0									
10100309	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	Commoners and aristocrats, aren't we humans at the end of the day? Come this way if you want to live!	0									
10100310	2	1	Commoner	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	……	0									
10100311	2	1	Commoner	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Okay, I got it!	0									
10100312	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	We're safe now.	0									
10100313	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	That's great...	0									
10100314	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	We'd better leave once we've planned our next step.	0									
10100315	2	1	System	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	(Akdilek Record)	0									
10100316	2	1	System	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	This train is refitted with the Central Purification Filter designs of the City Series of 020, 030, and 050.	0									
10100317	2	1	System	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	But the truth is, the filter is not capable of supporting the whole train.	0									
10100318	2	1	System	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Therefore, after the completion of all works, all carriages will be classified and, superior races will be separated from the inferior ones.	0									
10100319	2	1	System	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Like Babylonia, we will keep hope alive.	0									
10100401	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Sophia, enemy signals come from there!	0									
10100402	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	There's a ladder ahead on the train roof.	0									
10100403	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	If we'd been allowed to do our work earlier, none of this would've happened.	0									
10100404	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Message from the command center... Reinforcements?	0

10100604	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Hope I can still handle it.	0									
10100605	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	The gate operating system has been damaged a bit.	0									
10100606	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	We can find the parts from the nearby remains to repair it...	0

10100611	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Then, I only have to wait on the second floor.	0

10100617	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	But those track maintenance machines, whether they are personal property or not, are not allowed to be taken away from this station.	0

10100619	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	This is the Gestalt Order No. 202 approved by the World Government. Please keep calm and follow the order.	0									
10100620	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	The train will pass through here soon enough.	0									
10100621	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	But the gate has blocked the passage. We have to close it again as soon as possible.	0

10100902	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Wait, slow down!	0									
10100903	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	The train runs too fast, but I can't lag behind anymore. Commandant needs me.	0

10101002	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	It's still moving forward. The train will stop running if the engine is corrupted, and the people will...	0									
10101003	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	The filter will go down if the train stops...	0									
10101004	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Which means arriving at the terminal earlier than expected?	0									
10101005	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png	This isn't the train's terminal... Our train won't stop there!	0

10122307	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	What do you mean? Who are you then?	0									
10122308	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Going back will take your precious time. So if you are after the Ascendants—	0									
10122309	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Answer my questions, and you may pass. Of course, you are also welcome to break through with force.	0

10122313	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	So she's controlling the passage here. Alright.	0									
10122314	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Are you ready? Let's begin...	0									
10122315	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	The first question is...	0									
10122316	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Here comes the second question...	0									
10122317	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	And the third question is...	0									
10122318	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Light and shadow are one and the same. Where the light flourishes, the shadow also prospers.	0									
10122319	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	In the courtyard there is an abundance of light, in the shadows the answer hides.	0									
10122320	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	"Show me the ""Lightless Veranda"" should you seek the truth."	0									
10122321	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	That is all. Do take your time.	0									
10122322	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	"What does ""lightless"" mean...? It's so bright everywhere."	0									
10122323	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	No. There is one place without light.	0									
10122324	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Commandant, please make your decision.	0									
10122325	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Compared with the other verandas...	0									
10122326	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	This one isn't any different...	0									
10122327	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Not quite... Just look up...	0									
10122328	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Oh...! I see...!	0									
10122329	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	This is what differs this veranda from the others.	0									
10122330	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	I see... The light isn't on...	0									
10122331	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	"Is that what ""lightless"" meant?"	0									
10122332	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Wind flows through the void, traveling to and fro in the courtyard.	0									
10122333	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	But anchored is your answer, untouched it is by ebbs and flows.	0									
10122334	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	"Should you desire the truth, locate the ""Chamber of Windrest""."	0									
10122335	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	"She said ""windrest""... Hmm..."	0									
10122336	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Ah, I got it! The wind must stop somewhere!	0									
10122337	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Commandant, we just have to find a place without wind.	0									
10122338	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	I can't put it into words, but...	0									
10122339	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	I have a feeling that this is the place.	0									
10122340	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Hmm... Looking up close, the wind here is a lot weaker.	0									
10122341	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	See, the painting is barely moving.	0									
10122342	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Causes criss-crosses with effect. That which touches this land not, therein your answer lies.	0									
10122343	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	"You will find your answer in the ""Pavilion of Difference""."	0									
10122344	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	That which exists here not shall lead you to the pavilion.	0									
10122345	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	"Did she mention ""difference""?"	0									
10122346	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	There are three shades of different machines. Looks like we need to find the correct answer from them...	0									
10122347	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	One of them is different from the others. Commandant, it's very obvious, don't you think?	0									
10122348	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	I knew it...	0									
10122349	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	One of the illusions is different from the rest.	0									
10122350	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	Different? What do you mean...	0									
10122351	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	This Heteromer unit is only seen in Asslam. It doesn't exist in this city.	0									
10122352	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	"That's the ""difference"" she was talking about."	0									
10122353	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Very well. Would you like a compliment?	0									
10122354	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	"Defeat the ""answer"" to complete my challenge."	0									
10122355	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Very well. Not many can spot the difference.	0									
10122356	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	"Next, you only need to defeat the ""answer""."	0									
10122357	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	A splendid display. I have underestimated you.	0									
10122358	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	"Go. The ""answer"" is right ahead."	0									
10122359	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	A pity. You did not understand my message.	0									
10122360	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	My my. Are you uncultured, or purely daft?	0									
10122361	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Are you still lost? Yet truth is one and only.	0									
10122362	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	It's a shame. Though your determination does pique my interest.	0									
10122363	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Very well... We shall consider this done.	0									
10122364	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	You have passed my first test.	0									
10122365	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	In front of you is the guardian of the courtyard.	0									
10122366	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Defeat it to prove your strength.	0									
10122367	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	A less than satisfactory performance, but, you pass.	0									
10122368	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Make your way through. Qu is at the top of the tower.	0									
10122369	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	How unexpected. Truly amazing. Should we have a chat, good people from Babylonia?	0									
10122370	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Who are you? I don't feel any hostility from you.	0									
10122371	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	I am hostile, though perhaps not as much as the others. I'm a member of the Kowloong Crew, after all.	0									
10122372	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Kowloong Crew... What's your relationship with those on the Nighter...?	0									
10122373	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	They replicated our system. On the Nighter, they have nine members.	0									
10122374	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	But right here in Kowloong, we have nine crews.	0									
10122375	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAila1.png	So... Nine special departments in the city?	0									
10122376	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	You can say that. Plus, not all of us are involved in such reckless warfare.	0									
10122377	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	So, not everyone's supporting Qu?	0									
10122378	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	She's only a vessel of the will of the majority. And she knows that.	0									
10122379	2	1	Yazi (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YaziNormal01.png	Anyway, consider this a little nice gesture. I shall waste no more of your time.	0

10115209	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	You got it!	0									
10115210	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	What's that noise... I'll go check!	0									
10115211	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Come back! I need to upload the image data to the system terminal for further analysis...	0

10130204	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Dammit, it's a defensive data tide!	0									
10130205	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	No matter what went through, we'll have to go through this if we want to find it.	0									
10130206	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Phew... It's finally gone.	0									
10130207	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	The signal trails back to the main elevator... We'll have to go back and keep searching...	0

10130302	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	If those Defense Programs activated the alarm, we'll be facing a lot more of them.	0

10130304	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	It's a long story. I have my mission too.	0									
10130305	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	But now that we're heading the same way, let's stick together.	0									
10130306	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	There are some Defense Programs patrolling this area... Let's get rid of them before they raise the alarm.	0									
10130307	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Are they trying to protect something?	0									
10130308	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	From their patrol pattern, I don't see anything worth our attention. Maybe we'll find some clues in this area.	0									
10130309	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Let's search around then.	0									
10130310	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	No luck here. We'll have to...	0

10130506	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	...She's even hijacked the security barrier module.	0									
10130507	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	The port to deactivate it is on the other side... We can't do anything from here.	0

10131003	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	I got this.	0

10131501	2	1	Murol	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	The rest have been drawn off. We've just got this Riot left, right?	0									
10131502	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Affirmative. Take down the Riot model before Hiro comes back, then sweep and clear all Corrupted elements.	0									
10131503	2	1	Xun	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Five-by-five! Let's go, Murol!	0

10131505	2	1	Xun	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Got it! What a naughty thing.	0									
10131506	2	1	Murol	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Hurry and finish it off, Lucia.	0									
10131507	2	1	Murol	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	We can't move while holding it here. The enemy can easily target us!	0

10131512	2	1	Xun	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Must be the Punishing Virus.	0									
10131513	2	1	Xun	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Records indicate that the virus has rewritten and repaired its hosts before.	0									
10131514	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png	Which also means that our attacks are working. Keep up the good work.	0

10131519	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	I see... All I remembered was the electronic shackle on Riot had somehow disappeared.	0									
10131520	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	I didn't know I was the only one left.	0									
10131521	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	But that's okay. I will take on it by myself, just like what I did last time!	0									
10131522	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	No, Lucia. You have us now!	0									
10131523	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Can't maximize the efficiency if you fight alone while there are teammates around.	0

10131525	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	I don't have to fight alone anymore.	0

10140302	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	At any rate, there are only scorched earth and ashes left.	0									
10140303	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	But it is true that high concentrations of Punishing Virus can be detected occasionally.	0									
10140304	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	I'll set up the detection device while you go and check the situation below.	0									
10140305	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Let me know if you find anything.	0									
10140306	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Isn't this the core strike zone of the Longinus Arsenal?	0									
10140307	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Why are there Hetero-Creatures here?!	0									
10140308	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	It seems that the previous detection was not a false positive.	0									
10140309	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	There are some things hidden nearby.	0									
10140310	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	These Hetero-Creatures are frailer than before.	0									
10140311	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Ah, so you've taken care of them as well...	0									
10140312	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	The same is true for upper floor. Some Hetero-Creatures here and there, but it's easily taken are of.	0									
10140313	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	I guess it may be because the Red Tide is declining.	0									
10140314	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	High levels of Punishing Virus can also be detected in the boxes nearby.	0									
10140315	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Although it may be residue, just to be safe...	0									
10140316	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Let's break them all open and check!	0									
10140317	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Yes, that's right.	0									
10140318	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Wanna bet and see who finds more hidden Hetero-Creatures?	0									
10140319	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Why would I do something like that…	0									
10140320	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	But I'll come to your aid if you're in trouble.	0									
10140321	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Deal!	0									
10140322	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Wait, that sounded from above.	0									
10140323	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Is there a new batch Hetero-Creatures?	0									
10140324	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Let's go check it out!	0									
10140325	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Ugh, there's more!	0									
10140326	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	They don't seem to have been lurking here all the time.	0									
10140327	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Maybe they came from somewhere else?	0									
10140328	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Not too many enemies left, let's get it over with.	0									
10140329	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	What are these?!	0									
10140330	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	A new variety.	0									
10140331	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	There's not a lot of them. Maybe they got separated or only they survived?	0									
10140332	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	This area has been cleared.	0									
10140333	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Well, the Punishing concentration was also detected to be abnormal.	0									
10140334	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	OK, let's call Capt over.	0									
10140335	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	This area has been cleared.	0									
10140336	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Wanshi, how's it going over there?	0									
10140337	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Hmm? Are you still dealing with those detection device?	0									
10140338	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Let's go and check on him!	0									
10140350	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Wanshi! I did it!	0									
10140351	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	I see. I'll come over to help.	0									
10140352	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	All the boxes are checked!	0									
10140353	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	There's not too many, you can handle it yourself.	0									
10140354	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	I'll continue to install the detection device, so I'll leave the guarding to you.	0									
10140355	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Mission cleared! Looks like we finished at the same time!	0									
10140356	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	The Hetero-Creatures haven't given up attacking yet, let's move together.	0									
10140360	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	I knew there were still some here.	2									
10140361	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Looks like I was right.	2									
10140362	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	It's weak, and the Longinus Arsenal did a toll on it.	2									
10140363	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	These Hetero-Creatures have mastered many skills only seen in animals and insects, such as hiding.	2									
10140364	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Only residue left here.	2									
10140365	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	Punishing concentration also has the possibility of false positives.	2									
10140366	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	No news is good news.	2									
10140367	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWanshi1.png	...There's nothing inside.	2									
10140368	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	There really are Hetero-Creatures hiding here!	2									
10140369	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	What exactly did you do to avoid the Longinus Arsenal?	2									
10140370	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	I found another one!	2									
10140371	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Did you just come out and hide here?	2									
10140372	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Nothing!	2									
10140373	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Is it a good news that no Hetero-Creatures have been found?	2									
10140374	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	How's everything going over there, Wanshi?	2									
10140901	2	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	I just came up from below.	0									
10140902	2	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	The Red Tide over there is not enough to flood the whole underground waterway.	0									
10140903	2	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	But you don't need so many Red Tides to kill Constructs.	0									
10140904	2	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Get out of here. Even if it isn't flooded, the concentration of Punishing here is high enough to make us Corrupted.	0									
10140905	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	There are intercepted Hetero-Creatures everywhere.	0									
10140906	2	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Fall back while fighting.	0									
10140907	2	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	You are... not only injured, but also Corrupted.	0									
10140908	2	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	I wish Wanshi were here.	0									
10140909	2	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Damn, there's not even time for repairs.	0									
10140910	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	The concentration of Punishing is still rising.	0									
10140911	2	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	You better stay away from me, too, or you'll get worse.	0									
10140912	2	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	There you go again.	0									
10140949	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Looks like a switch connecting the gate.	0									
10140950	2	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	If the Red Tide wants to pass, this kind of thing can't stop it.	0									
10140951	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	It is enough to buy us some time.	0									
10140952	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	The concentration of Punishing behind us is very high, so there's no need to turn back.	0									
10140953	2	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Tsk... I thought you were so severely Corrupted that you couldn't tell the direction.	0									
10140961	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	It looks like a passage behind the door, but it's locked.	0									
10140962	2	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Nothing a bit of violence can't solve.	0									
10140963	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	No, this place has been in disrepair for a long time, and damage may cause it to collapse.	0									
10140964	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	But this lock is very old, and it can be opened if we have the key.	0									
10140965	2	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Well, let's look for it then.	0									
10140966	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	The door opened.	0									
10140967	2	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Looks like a shortcut.	0									
10140968	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	I got the key, it should open the door from earlier.	0									
10140970	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	We're very close to the upper floor.	0									
10140972	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	The Red Tide is about to flood here.	0									
10140973	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Hurry up, go up the ladder to the upper floor.	0									
10140974	2	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	No, you go first.	0									
10140975	2	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	Don't you hear that? A mass of Hetero-Creatures are coming.	0									
10140976	2	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	One of us should be left behind to take care of it.	0									
10140977	2	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKamu1.png	If these get through, none of us will be able to get out.	0									
10140978	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Camu...	0									
10140979	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	Take care, meet us soon!	0									
10140980	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	This valve seems to be used to divert water channels. What should I do?	0									
10140981	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	It seems to be a locked door to a shortcut. What should I do?	0									
10140982	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	I found a dusty key, what should I do?	0									
10140983	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png	The equipment over there seems to be used to divert the waterway. What should I do?	0									
10141201	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	Blocking the red tide, while looking for her. That's what we are here to do.	0									
10141202	2	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	It seems you are the closest to the control room!	0									
10141203	2	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	If you want a clue, knock on the old console over there.	0									
10141204	2	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	I think we should deal with the Red Tide first.	0									
10141205	2	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	But when the valve is blocked, these Hetero-Creatures will get mad.	0									
10141211	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	The valve is right here. Get rid of it first.	0									
10141212	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	The Red Tide leaked? Did they come from other unblocked places?	0									
10141213	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	Although the current Inver-Device has been enhanced, it is still fatal to be drenched by it.	0									
10141214	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	I need something to stop it.	0									
10141215	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	Let's pass like this first.	0									
10141216	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	But... what's the sound?	0									
10141217	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	It's nothing new.	0									
10141219	2	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Some Hetero-Creatures are heading toward you.	0									
10141220	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	How troublesome.	0									
10141221	2	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	...Hello, hello, are you still alive?	0									
10141222	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	?	0									
10141223	2	1	??	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Aahhhhh!	0									
10141224	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	What's going on?	0									
10141225	2	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	I found a Construct entangled by Hetero-Creatures.	0									
10141226	2	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	It's alive.	0									
10141227	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	Well, they're safe now so just leave them there.	0									
10141228	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	It's not that we can't manage, but we have to go to the control room first.	0									
10141230	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	I'm here.	0									
10141231	2	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	I hope you can find clues on that rusty machine, bless you!	0									
10141232	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	Shut up.	0									
10141233	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	...Endless troubles.	0									
10141234	2	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	I'm trying to seal off the Red Tide leaks and install the Polyfurnace.	0									
10141235	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	OK, I'll go back and screw on those valves.	0									
10141236	2	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	The flow rate is reduced, Capt. Go on next valve.	0									
10141240	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	It seems that there is no information here except trouble.	0									
10141241	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	What's going on at your side?	0									
10141242	2	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Not much different! Let's check once more and then go back. I don't want to be swallowed up by trouble.	0									
10141243	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	There are more floors here. You can't leave until all of them are carefully checked.	0									
10141244	2	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Huh? Why?!	0									
10141245	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	What about No. 21?	0									
10141246	2	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	I'm still trying to seal off the Red Tide leaks and install the Polyfurnace.	0									
10141247	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	Finish our original tasks and then meet at the exit.	0									
10141280	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaNormal01.png	The valve in the piston area can be opened first. What should I do?	0

992008405	2	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuyuyiNormal01.png	The rest go and attack that demon king. I've got the saintess.	0

992008408	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LifuyongzhuangNormal01.png	Run, demon king!	0									
992008501	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	The demon king is being surrounded by the soldiers. Defeat the soldiers and save him.	0									
992008502	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	We saved the demon king.	0									
992008503	2	1	Demon King	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YijukongzhongjianshiqiNormal01.png	Every time I show up, I end up crying for help... I feel more like a princess than a demon king.	0									
992008601	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KalieyongzhuangNormal01.png	Give me the treasure!	0									
992008602	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Okay... I will cooperate.	0									
992008603	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KalieyongzhuangNormal01.png	I don't need your cooperation!	0									
992008604	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1.png	Commandant, Karenina ran into the enemy horde.	0									
992008605	2	1	King	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/HasangNomal01.png	Good. Now is the time to catch the hero with the treasure.	0

992008701	2	1	Demon King	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YijukongzhongjianshiqiNormal01.png	Cut the crap and tell me what you know about the treasure.	0									
992008702	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LiyongzhuangNormal01.png	Vera and Camu made the fake treasure... Only they would do something like that.	0									
992008703	2	1	Demon King	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YijukongzhongjianshiqiNormal01.png	But didn't they side with the king in order to win?	0									
992008704	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LiyongzhuangNormal01.png	I don't know what happened exactly, but Karenina decided to play along.	0									
992008705	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LiyongzhuangNormal01.png	She gave one treasure to the king and kept the other.	0									
992008706	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LiyongzhuangNormal01.png	So it doesn't matter if the king got the fake treasure, because the real treasure has been collected in full at the city gate.	0									
992008707	2	1	Demon King	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YijukongzhongjianshiqiNormal01.png	Wow... That's...	0									
992008708	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	The plan may have worked, but the treasure is still somewhere inside the castle. We must get to it as quickly as we can.	0									
992008801	2	1	King	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/HasangNomal01.png	Damn it... Don't think you can defeat me just because my HP becomes visible!	0

992008807	2	1	Demon King	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/YijukongzhongjianshiqiNormal01.png	The light... This is the real treasure. I'm sure of it!	0									
992008808	2	1	King	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/HasangNomal01.png	Why is there a fifth treasure? Did you lie to me, heroes?	0									
992008901	2	1	King	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/HasangNomal01.png	Let me show you the power of a furious king!	0

992009003	2	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KamuyuyiNormal01.png	Hmph...	0									
992009004	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilayueduiNormal01.png	Lost?	0

992009006	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Camu, Vera, please join our team.	0									
992009101	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	...Is this the final opponent?	0

15010603	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	What's that wheel... in the distance?	0									
15010604	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	A Ferris wheel, I think. I saw it in a magazine once.	0									
15010605	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Looks to me just like a ring-shaped elevator.	0

15010609	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	They say Golden Age people like vintage things that let them live in the past.	0									
15010610	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Roland might have used it.	0

15010693	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Why is there a watermelon at the doorstep?	0									
15010694	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	According to the database, that appears to be a park mascot that failed to make the cut.	0

1501040118	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	Let move toward where they came from.	0									
1501040119	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	Is that a... door?	0									
1501040120	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Looks like so.	0									
1501040121	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	There is a huge area behind the door.	0

1501040203	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Maybe they came from the surface and accidentally ended up here?	0									
1501040204	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	A closed gate... Jitterbombs... I have a plan.	0

1501040207	1	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Good, we can take the Jitterbomb all the way to the gate.	2

1501040216	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1S.png	You're right. We should be able to enter the city via the gate ahead. Let's go.	0

1501052001	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/R2LifuNormal01.png	Is that the factory over there? Looks the same as where we've just been through.	0									
1501052002	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	That's why I said the city planning here was horrible.	0

1501052009	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/R2LifuNormal01.png	That was very powerful. Are you alright, Lee?	0									
1501052010	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Not a big deal, don't worry.	0

1501053703	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	The Red Tide will rise when this sound starts. Don't go in.	3									
1501053704	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Find somewhere to land in advance. Then keep moving once the sound stops, and the Red Tide will fall.	3									
1501053705	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Those traces ahead... should be footprints.	0									
1501053706	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Still fairly new. Must be from that kid.	0

1501053709	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Get over there and wait for the tide to fall.	3									
1501053710	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	It's gone. Continue with the operation.	3

1501053715	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Hope he didn't encounter any Hetero-Creature or jumped into the Red Tide himself.	0

1501053720	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Hmm... Why would he stand here for so long? Did he see anything?	0

1501053727	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	Hmm... The Hetero-Creatures nearby are eliminated. I can focus on the search now.	3									
1501053728	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WanshiNormal01.png	There are three spots we can use to hide from the tide.	6

301600493	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR5Yongyechao1.png	"By the way, I've invited some ""friends"" as lovely as me to the challenge. Good luck, Commandant!"	3									
301600494	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR5Yongyechao1.png	Commandant! The durability of the Iso-Device is at 70%. Pay attention!	3									
301600495	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR5Yongyechao1.png	"Com—man—dant! The durability of the Iso-Device is at 50%! You need to get rid of those ""friends""!"	3									
301600496	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR5Yongyechao1.png	COMMANDANT! There's only one Iso-Device left! If Karen finds out they're all broken, I'll be in big trouble!	3									
301600497	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR5Yongyechao1.png	Noooooo! They're all gone...	3									
301600498	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR5Yongyechao1.png	Good job! I knew that our wise, brave, and resourceful Commandant would pass my test! Take the reward!	3									
301600499	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Hello, Commandant! Today, I'll quiz you on your guard tactics.	3									
301600500	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	Iso-Devices have already been deployed. Your objective: protect all Iso-Devices and clear up all enemy units.	3									
301600501	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	The durability of the Iso-Devices is at 70%. Please pay attention to how you adjust your overall tactics.	3									
301600502	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	The durability of the Iso-Devices has been reduced to 50%. I recommend clearing the range targets that pose the highest threat first.	3									
301600503	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	The durability of the Iso-Devices is at 20%. This is not looking good, Commandant. Please clear out the remaining threats immediately!	3									
301600504	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	All Iso-Devices have been destroyed—I'm ending the test now. I hope you will perform better next time, Commandant.	3									
301600505	2	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadBianka1SS.png	All enemy units have been cleared. The Iso-Devices are confirmed to be functional, and you've completed your objective. You can claim your reward now, Commandant!	3									
301600506	2	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadPulao1.png	It's transportation challenge time! If the Transport Kuroro gets hit before it arrives at the gate, you'll have to start all over again!	3									
301600507	2	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadPulao1.png	Understand the rules, Commandant? Then let's start the challenge!	3									
301600508	2	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadPulao1.png	クロロ……	3									
301600509	2	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadPulao1.png	Err... Need a hand?	3									
301600510	2	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadPulao1.png	You did it! Woo-hoo! Here's a reward, Commandant!	3									
301600511	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Hello there, Commandant! Welcome to my Transport Challenge! Your mission today is to transport the super cute Kuroro!	3									
301600512	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Try your best to complete it in one go! Oh, aren't you the sweetest thing, Commandant? Good luck!	3									
301600513	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Just a teeny-tiny mistake from Commandant, I think...	3									
301600514	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Ah... I have to come up with a way to help Commandant.	3									
301600515	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Hey! Commandant, take this Shield Generator. I borrowed it from Karen just now!	3									
301600516	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	It doesn't seem to be enough. Let Nanami make some modifications!	3									
301600517	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Sigh... It's still not good enough?!	3									
301600518	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	If you... Hmph...	3									
301600519	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	If you fail again, I'll have to bring out the big guns!	3									
301600520	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	From the hate-scorched sky, with righteous anger in our hearts!	3									
301600521	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1SS.png	Thank you, Commandant! Thank you for helping our lovely Kuroro! Hehe!	3									
301600522	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadHakama1.png	Hi, Commandant. I'll be helping you with the transport challenge today.	3									
301600523	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadHakama1.png	Same as before, your target is to transport Kuroro to the destination.	3									
301600524	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadHakama1.png	Failure is also part of the challenge. Don't give up, Commandant!	3									
301600525	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadHakama1.png	Keep your cool, Commandant. Face the challenge level-headed.	4									
301600526	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadHakama1.png	Considering the possibilities, I've activated the shield generator. Keep forging ahead, Commandant!	4									
301600527	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadHakama1.png	Seems like I need to increase the shield's energy. High output mode activated. Keep forging ahead, Commandant!	4									
301600528	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadHakama1.png	I didn't anticipate these results. Seems I need to re-evaluate your abilities and adjust the difficulty.	3									
301600529	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadHakama1.png	You don't look well, Commandant. Maybe you should take a break.	3									
301600530	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadHakama1.png	You look worse for wear. You really need to take a break.	3									
301600531	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadHakama1.png	According to my calculations, your body is already overloaded and is no longer suitable for challenges. I'll help you achieve your goal!	3									
301600532	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadHakama1.png	You've met the transportation goal! Here's your reward, Commandant.	3									
301600533	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	I didn't expect to see you here, Commandant!	3									
301600534	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	I've increased the difficulty of your little challenge of transporting Kuroro. You'll have to do better if you want your rewards.	3									
301600535	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Nothing unexpected. Work harder, Commandant.	3									
301600536	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Do you want me to give you a hand? Though support from Cerberus is expensive.	3									
301600537	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	But you are the commandant of Gray Raven... Call it a favor. We'll say you owe me one.	3									
301600538	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Twice you've owed me, now. I can't wait to see how you pay me back.	3									
301600539	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Are you so desperate to please me?	3									
301600540	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	You mean you want me to do it myself?	3									
301600541	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Maybe next time I will do it myself!	3									
301600542	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Let me feel more pain!	3									
301600543	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	So this is what the commandant of Gray Raven is capable of. Alright, here are your rewards.	3									
301600544	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Commandant... We are... responsible for... preparing... Cathy... I am... on the... way.	3									
301600545	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	There is... danger on the road. We need... your help! We thank you, Commandant!	3									
301600546	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Cathy... under attack! But... we can still hold out!	3									
301600547	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Cathy... injured! Requesting assistance! Requesting assistance!	3									
301600548	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Cathy... severely injured! Help! Help!	3									
301600549	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Cathy... have failed... the mission. S-s-sorry*^&%&*...	3									
301600550	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Thank you... Commandant! The Festival will be... more exciting... with your participation!	3									
301600551	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuolan1.png	Good morning! Gray Raven Commandant, your challenge is to escort Kuroro through the haunted house. I'm sure it won't be difficult for you.	3									
301600552	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuolan1.png	I know this place like the back of my hand. You might just benefit greatly by listening to my suggestions.	3									
301600553	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuolan1.png	See the trajectory of those obstacles? They're quite fixed, aren't they? You wouldn't have hit them, would you?	3									
301600554	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuolan1.png	Hmm... It appears you need some assistance. Is that correct?	3									
301600555	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuolan1.png	"Give it a try. I prepared this gadget myself. It should be of quite some ""use"" to you."	3									
301600556	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuolan1.png	Uh-oh. Doesn't seem like the Kuroro can take much more.	3									
301600557	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuolan1.png	Time to clear the area. You can head back now. Gray Raven Commandant, be sure to give it your all next time.	3									
301600558	2	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuolan1.png	Not bad. Seems you're more capable than I thought. Here's a reward as a token of my approval.	3									
301600300	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Kalienina1.png	Hey! Gray Raven Commandant, the challenge I've prepared for you is the same as before. Avoid the light wall and hold out until the end!	3									
301600301	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Kalienina1.png	You will be deducted 20 points each time you touch the light wall. encounter a light curtain. If your points fall to 0, I'm sending you out into space!	3									
301600302	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Kalienina1.png	I'll reward you with more points for every few seconds you hold out. The laser wall will last for about one minute. Get ready! Go!	3									
301600303	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Kalienina1.png	The first light wall is approaching. Get ready. This one is just a warm-up.	3									
301600304	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Kalienina1.png	The 2nd light wall is approaching. This one's a little harder. Think you can take it?	3									
301600305	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Kalienina1.png	The last light wall is approaching! Almost there!	3									
301600306	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Kalienina1.png	Dammit... Ugh... You completely dodged all the light walls... Where'd you learn to be so strong?!	3									
301600307	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Kalienina1.png	Very well... Here's your reward! I'll have even harder light walls in the future. You better be ready!	3									
301600308	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Kalienina1.png	Eh, I guess you pass. I could've dodged all of them...	3									
301600309	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Kalienina1.png	By the way, I keep my words regarding rewards. Here you go!	3									
301600310	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Kalienina1.png	And the results are... You pass. Too bad you touched the light walls...	3									
301600311	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Kalienina1.png	Forget it—I shouldn't have expected so much of you. Go and get your rewards. Work harder next time.	3									
301600312	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Kalienina1.png	Oof... That was hard to watch. I guess I'll go easy on you this time. You won't be so lucky next time!	3									
301600313	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Kalienina1.png	Stop! Stop! Stop! Is this really all you got, Gray Raven Commandant?	3									
301600314	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Kalienina1.png	You better practice more first! Quit trying my patience! I'm not Lucia!	3									
301600320	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR5Yongyechao1.png	Whew! Commandant, welcome to my Dodge Challenge! Your objective today is to dodge! Dodge the laser walls!	3									
301600321	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR5Yongyechao1.png	Every time you hit the laser wall, I will deduct 20 points! If your score is at 0...	3									
301600322	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR5Yongyechao1.png	I'm gonna make Power capture you, Commandant! Of course, I'll give you points for every second you hold out!	3									
301600323	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR5Yongyechao1.png	The challenge will last for about one minute in total! Commandant, do your best! I'll be waiting for you here!	3									
301600324	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR5Yongyechao1.png	Ding! The first wave of laser wall strikes! It's quite simple!	3									
301600325	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR5Yongyechao1.png	Ding! Ding! The second wave of laser wall strikes! I've made it harder! I believe you can dodge it all!	3									
301600326	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR5Yongyechao1.png	Ding! Ding! Ding! The third wave of massive laser wall strikes! Difficulty UP! But—I'll always believe in you!	3									
301600327	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR5Yongyechao1.png	Perfect!!! You dodged all the light walls! Absolutely amazing! Here's your reward!	3									
301600328	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR5Yongyechao1.png	Plus an extra one just for you! Hehe!	3									
301600329	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR5Yongyechao1.png	Awesome! You've dodged most of the laser wall! These rewards are yours. I believe you will be able to dodge them all next time!	3									
301600330	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR5Yongyechao1.png	Although you broke some laser walls, it's alright! You can still have these rewards. Try harder next time!	3									
301600331	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR5Yongyechao1.png	You broke a lot of laser walls, but you've still successfully completed the challenge! Claim the rewards! You just need more practice!	3									
301600332	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR5Yongyechao1.png	You're toast, Commandant! 0 points! Attack, Power! Better luck next time!	3									
301600340	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Kalienina1.png	Hmph. I'm back, Gray Raven Commandant. This time, you won't be able to dodge the light walls so easily!	3									
301600341	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Kalienina1.png	In this challenge, the points you get every second is linked to the score. Hitting the wall will deduct 20 points and your score will be reset.	3									
301600342	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Kalienina1.png	Same rules as before. If you fall to 0 points, I'm sending you out into space! Ready? The light walls won't stop this time!	3									
301600343	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Kalienina1.png	I admit defeat, Gray Raven Commandant... Take your damn reward. Next time will be even harder. Just you wait!	3									
301600344	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Kalienina1.png	You performed very well. Although you hit the laser wall, you've exceeded my expectations. Now, claim these rewards!	3									
301600345	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Kalienina1.png	Hmph, I knew this one would be difficult for you, but your overall performance wasn't too bad! Take your rewards!	3									
301600346	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Kalienina1.png	Is that all you got? Forget it. Just take your reward. I hope you surprise me next time.	3									
301600347	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Kalienina1.png	Hahaha! I knew that no one could dodge the laser wall I designed this time.	3									
301600348	2	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Kalienina1.png	You'd better come prepared next time... How about you get out of here before I finish warming up?	3									
301600349	2	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Sailinna1.png	Ready, Commandant? The performance is about to start! Focus!	3									
301600350	2	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Sailinna1.png	This time, you won't lose points for touching the lasers. But you'll lose HP! So be careful!	3									
301600351	2	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Sailinna1.png	It's showtime! Follow the rhythm, Commandant!	3									
301600352	2	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Sailinna1.png	Perfect! I'm glad we can have such an amazing performance together!	3									
301600353	2	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Sailinna1.png	It wasn't a perfect performance, but I'm glad you tried.	3									
301600354	2	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Sailinna1.png	That's all folks... Commandant, you must be tired. Get some rest.	3									
301600355	2	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Sailinna1.png	You can do it, Commandant!	3									
301600356	2	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Sailinna1.png	You don't look so good today. Maybe you should get some rest and come back later.	3									
301600357	2	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Sailinna1.png	You want to continue? Okay! That's the spirit, Commandant. Never give up! Let's keep going.	3									
301600359	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Please pay attention... to the flame... around you.	3									
301600360	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Getting attacked... by the flame... will deduct the score.	3									
301600361	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	More... flames have appeared.	3									
301600362	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Perfect-performance	3									
301600363	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Qualified-performance	3									
301600364	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Wholehearted-performance	3									
301600365	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Unwilling-performance	3									
301600366	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	It's a pity...	3									
301600367	2	1	Cathy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KaixiNormal01.png	Performance begins...	3									
301600600	2	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadTwentyone1.png	Hey! Gray Raven Commandant, the test is about to begin. Are you ready?	3									
301600601	2	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadTwentyone1.png	Ready? Then let's begin.	3									
301600602	2	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadTwentyone1.png	Device durability below 70%.	3									
301600603	2	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadTwentyone1.png	Device durability below 50%. Danger!	3									
301600604	2	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadTwentyone1.png	Device durability below 20%. The test is about to fail!	3									
301600605	2	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadTwentyone1.png	That concludes the test. The results are... you failed. Want to try again, Gray Raven Commandant?	3

300625032	2	1	Faye	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	It really is a trap!	0

300625043	2	1	Laro	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	At least we can say the mechanoid standing before us doesn't match the model.	0									
300625044	2	1	Rock	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	He called himself King Wrench XIV?	0									
300625045	2	1	Rock	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	But their models don't even match up, do they?	0									
300625046	2	1	Rock	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	The legendary mechanoid is just a Repairer. Seriously?	0									
300625047	2	1	Fredrik	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	We shouldn't let a suspicious mechanoid join us.	0									
300625048	2	1	Fredrik	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	But this guy—I feel like we share the same vibes!	0									
300625049	2	1	Fredrik	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	This isn't a human cosplaying as a Repairer, right?	0									
300625050	2	1	Faye	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Wrench? Can he tighten the screw on my butt? It's coming loose.	0									
300625051	2	1	Excited Member	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	XIV? Perhaps there's some connection to that lord. Hoo hoo...	0									
300625052	2	1	Laro	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	The mechanoid you brought back has been inspected.	0

300625054	2	1	Laro	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	But it's better to keep an eye on him.	0									
300625055	2	1	Fredrik	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	If you ask me, Commandant, I'll say he could be our extra help.	0									
300625056	2	1	Fredrik	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	And we can bring him along to fight the Corrupted.	0									
300625057	2	1	Fredrik	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	If he's truly on our side, we'll fight alongside him. Otherwise, we'll take him down as well.	0									
300625058	2	1	King Wrench XIV (???)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	The world has really changed! I'd never imagined there would come a day when my name means nothing at all!	0									
300625059	2	1	King Wrench XIV (???)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	Never mind, you've passed the trial, kid! (Finally found a living human!)	0									
300625060	2	1	King Wrench XIV (???)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	I saw it clearly from the beach! Your talent shouldn't be used merely for fighting the Corrupted!	0									
300625061	2	1	King Wrench XIV (???)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	Why not join me, and together we can achieve something big like restoring the glory of this wrench! No time to waste, let's go!	0									
300625063	2	1	King Wrench XIV (???)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	Come to think of it, it's hard to believe that I, King Wrench XIV, have been reduced to this!	0									
300625064	2	1	King Wrench XIV (???)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	But crossing your path on this island must be the choice of Steins Gate!	0									
300625065	2	1	King Wrench XIV (???)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	Even though you've never heard of my legend, you'll surely be awed after seeing my fighting skills!	0									
300625066	2	1	Rock	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Whether or not this guy can be trusted, I never imagined that King Wrench XIV would be anything more than a fanciful legend.	0									
300625067	2	1	Rock	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	The legendary yet mysterious mechanoid, the savior of new recruits...	0									
300625068	2	1	Rock	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	When was the last time I heard about his story?	3									
300625069	2	1	King Wrench XIV (???)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	Your fighting techniques are really something! Seems like I'm the one left behind the times!	0									
300625070	2	1	King Wrench XIV (???)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	My body is falling apart but you've shown that I can now entrust this battered body to you!	0									
300625071	2	1		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyongjianyingNomal01.png	Wait... I'm afraid—	0									
300625072	2	1	Support Force	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Corrupted signals detected upstairs.	2

300625074	2	1	Faye	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	I've heard that those who like King Wrench XIV aren't bad. A little help couldn't hurt—	0									
300625075	2	1	Faye	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Don't get me wrong! It'll only happen after we clear all the Corrupted! (Besides, no way it's real...)	0									
300625076	2	1	Faye	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Commandant... Watch out!	0									
300625077	2	1		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyongjianyingNomal01.png	If we don't have other missions... And he doesn't seem dangerous, so let's leave it as it is for now.	0									
300625078	2	1	King Wrench XIV (???)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	Just as expected, you and I really are a perfect partner!	0									
300625079	2	1	King Wrench XIV (???)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	Our top priority right now is to fix my lower body.	3									
300625080	2	1	King Wrench XIV (???)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	I used to be a fighter like you...	0									
300625081	2	1	King Wrench XIV (???)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	Then I took a shot in the knee... Anyway!	0									
300625082	2	1	King Wrench XIV (???)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	We have to find the parts to fix my lower body. Follow me!	0									
300625083	2	1	King Wrench XIV (???)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	The exit is over there.	2									
300625085	2	1	King Wrench XIV (???)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	I've already scouted this island. Only if there weren't so many Corrupted...	0									
300625086	2	1	King Wrench XIV (???)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	Only if I had my lower body!	0									
300625087	2	1	King Wrench XIV (???)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	This would be an amazing place for retirement—	0									
300625088	2	1	King Wrench XIV (???)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	Let's get moving before the sun goes set.	0									
300625089	2	1	King Wrench XIV (???)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	There's a door inside the aquarium ahead, and behind it is the last corrupted zone on this island.	0									
300625090	2	1	King Wrench XIV (???)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	I've also spotted a pale-skinned mechanoid with long legs going in and out the door!	3									
300625091	2	1	King Wrench XIV (???)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	I'm not certain what's happening behind that door, but I have a feeling it's something extremely dangerous. Be ready for anything!	0									
300625092	2	1	Faye	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	So all you wanted to say is you can't defeat it by yourself?	0									
300625093	2	1	King Wrench XIV (???)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	...Fine, you're right! If I wasn't afraid to die, I wouldn't have waited for you all! Let's just go open the door!	0									
300625094	2	1	King Wrench XIV (???)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	The aquarium is right ahead.	2									
300625096	2	1	Faye	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Its interior is bigger than I expected... My 20 years of gaming experience are telling me this doesn't seem good at all!	0									
300625097	2	1	King Wrench XIV (???)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	Anyway, help me find the parts first! And I know you like it, but you need to watch out for the long-legged mechanoid!	0									
300625098	2	1	King Wrench XIV (???)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	Well, though I don't hate it either...	0									
300625099	2	1	Faye	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	...Hmm?	3									
300625100	2	1		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyongjianyingNomal01.png	That is...?	3									
300625101	2	1	King Wrench XIV (???)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1BaohuzheMd000001.png	Give me spotlights! Hen—Shin!	2									
300625102	2	1	King Wrench XIV (??)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1XiulijigongMd000001.png	King Wrench XIV—has—arrived!	2									
300625103	2	1	King Wrench XIV (??)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1XiulijigongMd000001.png	How is this?	4									
300625104	2	1	Faye	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Whew! That killing aura is pretty impressive! But you can stop acting like a grandpa.	0									
300625105	2	1	King Wrench XIV (??)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/Mo1XiulijigongMd000001.png	Uh... It's not that... The screws are just too tight... I can't move the joints...	0									
300625106	2	1	Faye	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	I'm already worn out. Let's head back and sort it out—	0									
300625107	2	1	Laro	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	If you ask me...	0									
300625108	2	1	Laro	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	If we don't have other missions at the time being...	0									
300625109	2	1	Laro	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Then we can't simply leave him be. But before we proceed, I'll report back on the mission status.	0									
300625110	2	1	Rock	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Well... Judging from his appearance...	0									
300625111	2	1	Rock	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	He's definitely a Repairer, and that's the virus' favorite model!	0									
300625112	2	1	Rock	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	On top of that, his mobility is way too low! Should we take him apart and take a look inside?	0									
300625113	2	1	Fredrik	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	You remodeled it? So you're a real cosplayer!	0									
300625114	2	1	Fredrik	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	But—your tastes are quite strange.	0									
300625115	2	1	Fredrik	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Let me help you refine your tastes! Are you interested in cross-dressing?	0									
300625116	2	1	Faye	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Well, as long as his mechanical circuits are intact, I don't mind coming along...	0									
300625117	2	1	Excited Member	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Who said cross-dressing?!	0									
300625118	2	1	Laro	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Perhaps you should talk to everyone about what to do with that mechanoid, Commandant	0									
300625119	2	1	Laro	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Although he hasn't shown any signs of hostility so far...	0									
300625120	2	1	Laro	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	It may still cause misunderstandings if we bring him along with us.	0									
300625121	2	1	Fredrik	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	I say we've got to help him out to the end. What if he has a shapeshifting ability and he wants to repay us!	0									
300625122	2	1	Fredrik	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	And this can bring us closer together as a team. It hits two birds with one stone...	0									
300625123	2	1	Fredrik	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Oh, he can help us eliminate more Corrupted as well! We're gonna hit three birds instead! Though, I'll be going back with Laro.	0

1017011610	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Leave it to me. You go deal with the enemies. Don't let them get here.	4									
1017011611	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Activated. Now it shouldn't be a problem to kill these Hetero-Creatures.	4									
1017011612	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	This one looks different from what we've seen before.	0									
1017011613	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Enter Matrix. That's the only way to kill it.	0									
1017011614	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	They were already attracted.	0									
1017011615	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Kuluomu1.png	The twins are coming over. Prepare for retreat.	0									
1017011616	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	There are too many enemies... Eliminate them asap!	4									
1017011617	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png	Lee, how is it going? More and more Hetero-Creatures are coming over...	0									
1017011618	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	I need to focus.	3									
1018010211	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Snipey! It's a swing! Nanami can swing 2,000 swings per minute!	0									
1018010212	2	1	Sniper	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	That's awesome...	0									
1018010213	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Right? Nanami is awesome!	0									
1018010214	2	1	Sniper	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	No, I meant that swing.	0									
1018010221	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Mr. Zombie slide. It's inspired by the most popular anime character ever. Have you seen it, Snipey?	0									
1018010222	2	1	Sniper	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	No. It will only waste my storage space.	0									
1018010223	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	That's not good. How would you make friends at school if you don't watch the most popular anime?	0									
1018010224	2	1	Sniper	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	I don't go to school, so I don't need any friends there.	0									
1018010231	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	This is the octopus slide. And we can also play hide and see around it.	0									
1018010232	2	1	Sniper	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	It's a nice place to hide. You won't be found if you hide in the middle.	0									
1018010233	2	1	Sniper	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Even if they find you, you can immediately run away in any direction.	0									
1018010234	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	That's what I'm saying, Snipey!	0									
1018010241	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	The pumpkin baron! My favorite! And it's doll.	0									
1018010242	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	It can shoot its pumpkin head at the bade guy!	0									
1018010243	2	1	Sniper	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Seems it's just an auto sniper platform just like me except that I shoot bullets.	0									
1018010244	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	How I wish I could fire laser beams from my head...! NANAMI—BEEEEEEEAM!	0									
1018010251	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	This is a tramway above ground, plus many skyscrapers.	0									
1018010252	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	This place must have been filled with commuters...	0									
1018010253	2	1	Sniper	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Meaningless travel will only expose yourself. I'd rather stay put unless it's necessary.	0									
1018010254	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Then I guess you're a... homebody then.	0									
1018010261	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	This is the way to the recharge station. All these machines are energy-driven.	0									
1018010262	2	1	Sniper	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	The pursuit of endless energy makes humanity to research the Zero-point Energy.	0									
1018010263	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	The same goes with machines.	0									
1018010271	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	The rest area is ahead of us in this way.	0									
1018010272	2	1	Sniper	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Are you tired?	0									
1018010273	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	No. But sometimes it's not only the body that needs rest.	0									
1018010274	2	1	Sniper	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	But I think I'm more mentally tired than you.	0									
1018010275	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Then, how about...	0									
1018010276	2	1	Sniper	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	I'm good. Thank you.	0									
1018010281	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Snipey! It's a bus!	0									
1018010282	2	1	Sniper	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Why yelling? It's just a common vehicle.	0									
1018010283	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	The bus equals to travel! Travel with friends! Isn't it exciting?	0									
1018010291	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	The track extends into the distance... What do you say the tram goes to, Snipey?	0									
1018010292	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Could it be somewhere less cold?	0									
1018010293	2	1	Sniper	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Impossible. The entire Earth has already fallen into the Ever-Winter.	0									
1018010294	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	What a shame...	0									
1018010301	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	It's cold! Snipey, I'm gonna catch a cold.	0									
1018010302	2	1	Sniper	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	"Machines do not ""catch a cold,"" but the coldness will freeze their buffer fluid and slow down their movement..."	0									
1018010303	2	1	Sniper	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Do not stand still! Eliminate the Corrupted immediately... What are you doing?	0									
1018010304	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	One, two! One, two! Nanami is warming up, but I don't think I've seen any Corrupted...	0									
1018010305	2	1	Sniper	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Maybe it is not just us... Perhaps the Corrupted are also frozen in the cold weather.	0									
1018010311	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Look, Snipey! There's a little bird! It's frozen! Poor bird!	0									
1018010312	2	1	Sniper	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	"It does not look like a ""little"" bird to me..."	0									
1018010313	2	1	Sniper	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Hey, do not approach it. I detected high Punishing Virus concentration. It is a Corrupted!	0									
1018010314	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Huh?! Then we have to take it down! Snipey, Power, let's go!	0									
1018010321	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	There is a human ahead! Looks like that person is waving to us!	0									
1018010322	2	1	Sniper	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	It is impossible for humans to survive this cold weather with so few clothes on.	0									
1018010323	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Hello, how are you? Let's go have a look, Snipey!	0									
1018010324	2	1	Sniper	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	I genuinely suspect that there is something wrong with your auditory system. Get it fixed.	0									
1018010331	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Haha! It's Nanami and Commandant's snowman!	0									
1018010332	2	1	Sniper	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	The snowman would be buried in the snow in no time in the snowstorm. What you are doing is meaningless.	0									
1018010333	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	"It's a short ""moment"" for us, but it might be a long ""eternity"" for the snowman."	0									
1018010334	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Hmm... Something is missing here...	0									
1018010341	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Ta-da! Perfectly done!	0									
1018010342	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Nanami will find you, Commandant!	0									
1018010351	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	This human was a mechanoid... and seems to be dead.	0									
1018010352	2	1	Sniper	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	"Like I said... It is not ""dead."" It is ""down."" And looks like it is impossible to fix it."	0									
1018010353	2	1	Sniper	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	It is completely frozen. Destroy it if necessary. Let's get its memory unit out and have a look.	0									
1018010354	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Umm... I'd rather not. Just let it stay here in the snowstorm.	0									
1018010361	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	This human was a mechanoid... and seems to be dead.	0									
1018010362	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Perhaps it was a mechanoid who took human kids to the facilities in this amusement park.	0									
1018010363	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	After all, there are many facilities here. There must have been many kids who came here for them.	0									
1018010364	2	1	Sniper	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	I will not respond to a groundless speculation like this.	0									
1018010365	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	"Pfft. I thought ""the most important thing for a soldier is imagination""."	0									
1018010366	2	1	Sniper	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal01.png	Maybe I am not a qualified soldier...	0									
1018010401	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Is this the place?	0									
1018010402	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/HakamaNormal02.png	That's the entrance to the aviation lab. It seems it has already been occupied by a group of machines...	0									
1018010403	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Hello, can I borrow your machines?	0									
1018010404	2	1	Mechanoids	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/PaotaiNormal02.png	Don't... bother us... Don't!	0									
1018010405	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Ah! Why don't you just listen to me?	0									
1018010406	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/HakamaNormal02.png	Let's just take them down!	0									
1018010407	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	As long as we can find the port, we might be able to contact mecha babushka again...	0									
1018010408	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	They would have believed me if Snipey were here...	0

1502051001	2	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Hanying1.png	Yoyo... And the Nighter. Is this another dream?	0									
1502051002	2	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Hanying1.png	No, she isn't the real Yoyo. This isn't the real Nighter either.	0									
1502051003	2	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Hanying1.png	But why were there two strange butterflies around Yoyo...?	0									
1502051004	2	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Hanying1.png	The butterfly... has appeared again.	0									
1502051005	2	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Hanying1.png	If the butterfly is related to Yoyo... It could also be the key to leaving this place.	0

1502051305	2	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Hanying1.png	Maybe the answer is just behind it.	0

301304065	2	1	Commandant	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Move to the road on your right. That's right. At 3 o'clock.	0									
301304066	2	1	Commandant	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Lee. It's the opposite direction. You need to go into the market.	0									
301304067	2	1	Commandant	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Direction correct.	0									
301304068	2	1	Commandant	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Now the general direction is on your left.	0

311304065	2	1	Commandant	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Wrong direction. You are reaching the exit of the camp!	0									
311304066	2	1	Commandant	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Keep going and you'll go back to where you were earlier!	0

311304068	2	1	Commandant	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	That's right. Keep going!	0									
311304069	2	1	Commandant	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Now you're at a relatively broad area. You can take over from here and find your way with your scanner.	2									
321304061	2	1	Commandant	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	It's the remnant data from the bolts we are tracking.	0

1021010602	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Not at all. Everything is good. The adaptation is better than I expected.	0									
1021010603	2	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	Good. Seems the M.I.N.D. and frame are going well together.	0									
1021010604	2	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	Let's start the first test then. Use the basic abilities of your frame to defeat the enemy.	0									
1021010605	2	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	The mobility of this frame has been significantly improved based on your habits and requirements. It also comes with excellent firepower.	0									
1021010606	2	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	However, that will also increase your burden in combat. When facing a large number of enemies, you'll need to make use of all available weapons to quickly finish them off.	0									
1021010607	2	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	I'll give you plenty of Signal Orbs in the second test. Use your Composite Armaments to deal with the vast number of enemies.	0									
1021010608	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Okay. I think I've pretty much mastered this frame.	0									
1021010609	2	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	The basic abilities are enough for you to handle regular combat. But on top of that, we still plan to add a special power to this frame.	0									
1021010610	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Plan to...?	0									
1021010611	2	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	Right. For now, this feature only exists in theory...	0									
1021010612	2	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	"With its incredible instant computing power, when this frame is running at maximum output, it can even ""transcend beyond time and dimensions."""	0									
1021010613	2	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	"Let's just call it ""Hypermatrix"" for now. You can try using this feature in the simulated battle first."	0									
1021010614	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	I'm ready.	0									
1021010615	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Is this the Hypermatrix you mentioned?	0									
1021010616	2	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	Just like Matrix, it will forecast all possible enemy actions. They must be near stationary in your eyes.	0									
1021010617	2	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	But Hypermatrix is more than that.	0									
1021010618	2	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	The attack data from certain skills you used earlier will be stored within the core of your weapon.	0									
1021010619	2	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	In this space, you can access and reuse this information by attacking enemies.	0									
1021010620	2	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	Given its extremely high power consumption, the duration of Hypermatrix will likely be very limited.	0									
1021010621	2	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	Given its extremely high power consumption, the duration of Hypermatrix will likely be very limited.	0

1021010625	2	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	From now on, I'm going to load the data of some formidable enemies.	0									
1021010626	2	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	The system will no longer help you maintain Hypermatrix. You'll need to control it yourself.	0									
1021010627	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	I see.	0									
1021010628	2	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	Let's call it a day.	0									
1021010629	2	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	Your computing power is all drained... Let's call it a day before you put yourself in danger.	0									
1021010630	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Alright. I think we just need a few more tweaks before officially deploying the frame in combat.	0									
1021010631	2	1	Asimov	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/AximofuNomal01.png	The attack data from certain skills you used earlier will be stored within your weapon.	0

1021011202	2	1	Construct A	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal04.png	We have more mechanoids to get rid of over there... Have we locked down the hangar?	0									
1021011203	2	1	Construct B	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotinvNormal01.png	All done. Nobody can get in that route now!	0									
1021011204	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Did you lock down the route to the hangar? What's going on there?	0

1021011223	2	1	Crowe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V132gztNormal01.png	The HQ just ordered all normal Constructs to be on standby for combat. There shouldn't be any urgent mission.	0

1021011238	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	The gravity system was shut down? What happened in the control center...?	0

1021011243	2	1	Crowe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V132gztNormal01.png	As I keep the gravity field activated, I won't be able to deal with them.	0

1502041124	1	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Bambinata! What are you doing?!	4									
1502041125	1	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Can't even control your own doll, can you? Then, I won't hold back, either!	5									
1502040301	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	...I've heard some rumors about you before, dollface, that you lose your memory on occasion?	0									
1502040302	2	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Bangbinata1.png	Even if Bambinata's memory data is lost in battle, Bambinata can still access the data required for combat from the external memory module.	0									
1502040303	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Then what's the plan B if you're incapacitated on the battlefield?	0									
1502040304	2	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Bangbinata1.png	Mistress will have Bambinata act as a decoy to create an opening for the others.	0									
1502040305	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	So the rumors are true. No wonder the Egret only has you left now.	0									
1502040306	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Bambinata, what did the Science Council check on you before you set off for the mission?	0									
1502040307	2	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Bangbinata1.png	They tried to measure the latency by having Bambinata reassess data from the external module, but it was soon interrupted because of the mission.	0									
1502040308	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Just in case, access the data here one more time.	0									
1502040309	2	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Bangbinata1.png	Understood.	0									
1502040312	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	This time, we'll do it slowly. Access the data section by section, avoid data conflicts, and start with the simplest.	0

1502040317	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Oops, I thought your eye was still recovering.	0									
1502040318	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	I'm sure that Chief has thanked you in person for all your contribution despite the fact that you were a former rival, right?	0									
1502040319	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	For that person? What a terrible joke... Enough of this nonsense. Ready to engage!	0

1502040326	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Great, let's keep this going.	0									
1502040327	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Are your chores all finished now?	0									
1502040328	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	By the way, I'm usually highly efficient when I'm on my own.	0									
1502040329	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	So you two can continue playing your little mistress-and-servant game.	0									
1502040330	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Don't worry, I'll be giving the Egret five-star reviews in my mission report.	0									
1502040331	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	How nice of you. With a captain who is used to saying one thing but doing another...	0									
1502040332	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	I'm starting to feel sorry for Cerberus' commandant.	0									
1502040333	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Cerberus' commandant has absolute trust in me and will never treat me like a monitored subject. What do you say, dollface?	0									
1502040334	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	I'd rather say Cerberus' commandant is also struggling to discipline a vicious dog. We should exchange thoughts on this.	0									
1502040335	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Oh, unfortunately, my commandant has many more important jobs to do than listening to your constructive insights.	0									
1502040336	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	I don't think the things between higher-ups are for you to worry about.	0									
1502040337	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Toys should only do what toys are supposed to do. Now move in the 30-degree direction!	0									
1502040338	2	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Bangbinata1.png	Yes, Mistress.	0									
1502040339	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Hmph.	0									
1502040340	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Bambinata, check one more time if the ones on the tree are the same type of experimental Constructs that attacked us.	0									
1502040341	2	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Bangbinata1.png	Negative. The ones that attacked Mistress were the Corrupted.	0									
1502040342	2	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Bangbinata1.png	However, the remains on the tree are not simply experimental Constructs. Some of them also show faint Punishing Virus readings.	0									
1502040343	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Given that our target location is about 500 meters ahead, it's possible that it's already been invaded by the Corrupted.	0									
1502040344	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	We'll be moving forward stealthily from here on.	0									
1502040801	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Hmph, a welcome party like this...	0									
1502040802	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Trying to stall for time?	0									
1502040803	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	That Construct! Don't let him run away!	0									
1502040804	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	I know—	0									
1502040806	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	...Infighting?	0									
1502040807	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Shh! Don't alert them yet.	0									
1502040808	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	That Construct seems to be getting punished.	0									
1502040809	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Because he ran away?	0									
1502040810	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	If he retains such a strong will to survive, he may not have lost his mind completely.	0									
1502040811	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	What are you trying to say?	0									
1502040812	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	If he's still somehow sane, we can simply make him spit out where dollface is exactly.	0									
1502040813	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Your strategy's really...	0									
1502040814	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Let's capture him alive.	0									
1502040815	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Hey, it should be the commandant to give orders!	0									
1502040816	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	...Can you understand my words?	0									
1502040817	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Excellent. I won't hurt you if you can answer a few questions.	0									
1502040818	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Where is the little blue-and-white-dressed doll now?	0									
1502040819	2	1	Naughty	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	...Group...	0									
1502040820	2	1	Naughty	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	...Game... Time...	0									
1502040821	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	...You've got some nerve!	0									
1502040822	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Hold on, let's split up here.	0									
1502040823	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	You go after him. I'll head back to the security room and see if there are any more clues about those Constructs' intentions.	0									
1502040824	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Suit yourself, if you're so confident that you can protect yourself on your own.	0									
1502040825	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Ha, keep this to yourself.	0									
1502040826	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	If you need help, just yell for me. I can't miss this scene.	0									
1502040827	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	I'll give you one last chance.	0									
1502040829	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Game rules? What do they have to do with my question?	0									
1502040830	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Too bad you've wasted your last chance.	0									
1502040831	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Begging for your life? Or…	0									
1502040832	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Leading the way? I'd better follow him.	0									
1502040833	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	The game he mentioned before? Is it some kind of procedural behavior among those Constructs?	0									
1502040834	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Footsteps...	0									
1502040835	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Footsteps... As expected, it was stalling for time.	0									
1502040836	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	...Fair enough, but it's time to play my game. The ones lose the moment they get cut down—	0									
1502040837	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Let's have fun, shall we?	0									
1502040838	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Have you found any clues?	0									
1502040839	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Almost all the cameras were shut off.	0									
1502040840	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	But I managed to find a clip from about fifteen minutes ago. I'm syncing it to your terminal now.	0									
1502040841	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	...Your face looks like you've failed the mission and our transport craft was blown up.	0									
1502040842	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	...	0									
1502040843	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	What? Something even worse?	0									
1502040844	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	...No, I just saw something dull.	0									
1502040845	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	A pair of old ballet shoes... in a box?	0									
1502040846	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	...It's none of your business.	0									
1502040847	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Sync completed.	0									
1502040851	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Those Constructs were heading in the same direction before they disappeared.	0									
1502040852	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	That's the direction toward the end of the living room.	0									
1502040853	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	This is where they disappeared.	0									
1502040854	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Under the carpet must be a hidden door.	0									
1502040855	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	I've got this.	0									
1502040857	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	If your blade had gone just a bit more to the right, you'd be facing a court martial afterward.	0									
1502040858	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Accidents won't exist if they don't happen.	0									
1502040859	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Let's go.	0									
1502040860	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	Wait, before that, we should investigate all the unchecked rooms.	0									
1502040861	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	It's possible that Bambinata didn't act as we deduced.	0									
1502040862	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	If all those Constructs were really down here like the cameras showed, they could've overwhelmed us...	0									
1502040863	2	1	Vanessa	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131fnsNormal01.png	And our situation will be even more dire if Bambinata isn't there. Not to mention circling back to find her will require more time and effort.	0									
1502040864	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png	Fine, let's get going.	0									
13021401	2	1	Female Captain	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NvDuiZhangNormal02.png	The Corrupted have appeared. Prepare to engage!	0									
13021402	2	1	Female Construct	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotinvNormal01.png	Roger!	0									
13021403	2	1	Female Construct	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotinvNormal01.png	The defense force has been informed! Reinforcements are on their way!	0									
13021404	2	1	Female Captain	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NvDuiZhangNormal02.png	...	0									
13021405	2	1	Female Captain	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NvDuiZhangNormal02.png	Are you the reinforcements? But you don't seem to be on the drill roster...	0									
13021406	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal02.png	Drill? Oh, let's pretend you were saved by a masked superhero who happened to be passing by.	0									
13021407	2	1	Female Captain	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NvDuiZhangNormal02.png	Wait, where are you going?	0									
13021408	2	1	Female Captain	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NvDuiZhangNormal02.png	The area over there is conducting a security drill for the Mid-Autumn Festival celebrations. I can't let you through.	0									
13021409	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Ehhh?!	0									
13021410	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Plan B, Power! Let's go the other way!	0									
13021411	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	...	0									
13021412	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	The first floor is blocked off because of the drill... But the second floor is still accessible.	0									
13021413	2	1	Construct	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Are you... the Tank Construct of the Support Force?	0									
13021414	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/QishichaoNormal01.png	Um... Nanami's just passing by...	0									
13021415	2	1	Construct	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Whatever, it's good to have reinforcements here.	0									
13021416	2	1	Construct	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	The drill-specific robots over there have lost control. They need your help!	0

210001005	2	1	Construct Soldier Jerry	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	We should leave too!	0									
210001006	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	No. The target is moving way too fast. The Corrupted are going to hunt us down. We can't risk it.	0									
210001007	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	We hold off the Corrupted right here. Everyone else, evacuate immediately!	0

210001018	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	We can't let the Corrupted Colossus catch up with the evacuating crew. I'll hold it off!	3									
210001019	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Zachery was right. This is a tough opponent to deal with.	3									
210001020	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	I remember the shield could be neutralized...	0

210001051	2	1	Demolitionist Suma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V132snNormal01.png	Suma here. I have talked to Zachery about how to break the shield.	0									
210001052	2	1	Demolitionist Suma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V132snNormal01.png	Explosives have been set up on the evacuation route. If I detonate them from underground, they should be able to break its shield!	0									
210001053	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Well done. Let's go with Plan B. I will guide the target to the route, and you will decide when to blow it up.	0									
210001054	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Its shield may regenerate multiple times. Keep monitoring!	0

210001026	1	1	Demolitionist Suma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V132snNormal01.png	Detonation successful. The shield has disappeared!	3									
210001027	1	1	Demolitionist Suma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V132snNormal01.png	The shield has regenerated. Let's keep going.	3									
210001028	1	1	Demolitionist Suma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V132snNormal01.png	It's the second time now!	2									
210001029	1	1	Demolitionist Suma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V132snNormal01.png	The shield is gone! Attack now!	3									
210001030	1	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	One more time and it's dead!	3

210001034	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Target is highly damaged and close to ceasing activity.	0									
210001035	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Seems it still has some energy left...	0									
210001036	2	1	Demolitionist Suma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V132snNormal01.png	Shall we keep attacking?	0									
210001037	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	No, the Corrupted's actions are out of control. There's a higher risk if we approach it.	0									
210001038	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Just let its energy run out. The majority of us have already evacuated to a safe area. Tell the distraction team to continue with their mission.	0									
210001039	2	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png	Alright, we're about to wrap up the mission. Good work, everyone! Let's evacuate.	0

21000253	2	1	Chad	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Let's help Walker first. The grasshopper hit him hard.	3									
21000290	1	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LunaNormal03.png	You are too weak. You must accept the power of Ascension-Network.	0

1021021804	1	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	I'm trying to open a path to the top of the tower, but they are already here.	3									
1021021805	1	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Done. The path to the top is open now!	3									
1021021806	1	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	What happened?!	3									
1021021807	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	I knew it wouldn't be that easy... How's the situation over there?	0									
1021021808	2	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	So far so good. This wall should be part of the self-protection system of this tower.	0									
1021021809	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Can you break it from within?	0									
1021021810	2	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	I tried. Didn't work.	0									
1021021811	2	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Looks like I'm trapped here for now.	0									
1021021812	2	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	But if the spacetime here is all chaotic, there is no point to stall us.	0									
1021021813	2	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Be careful. This wall isn't just here to separate us.	0									
1021021814	2	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	I'll continue looking for a solution. Don't let down your guard.	0									
1021021815	2	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Watch your flank!	0									
1021021816	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Leave it to me.	3									
1021021817	2	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Good news. I found a vulnerability in this barrier.	0									
1021021818	2	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	If only I had enough firepower... My current weapon isn't capable of doing that much damage.	0									
1021021819	2	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	But you can.	0									
1021021820	1	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Great. I know I'm the best.	3									
1021021821	2	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Let's continue onward.	0									
1021021822	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	...	0									
1021012000	2	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	This should be the top of the tower.	0									
1021012001	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	What's that device over there...	0									
1021012002	2	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	...It's the core contained within the barrier.	0									
1021012003	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	It's emitting strong electro-magnetic interference... Looks like this is the key to stopping the disaster.	0									
1021012004	2	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	We need to break the barrier with heavy fire.	0									
1021012005	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	I don't think it will be that easy, but let's give it a try anyway.	0									
1021012006	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	That's what I thought... The attack didn't even reach the core.	0									
1021012007	2	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	If only we could get a little closer...	0									
1021012008	1	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Stop wasting energy. It won't work.	3									
1021012009	1	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	The barrier is part of the tower itself.	3									
1021012010	1	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	To deactivate it, we need to find the energy cores that are hidden in different locations.	3									
1021012011	1	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	But before that... Let's deal with them first.	3									
1021012012	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	No more signs of Hetero-Creature activities.	3									
1021012013	2	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	He... I mean, the other me, might have progressed further than I have.	0									
1021012014	2	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	But we still failed to find the solution...	0									
1021012015	2	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	I'll keep this short. I've been here before, but could not break through this barrier.	0									
1021012016	2	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	I hate to admit this, but my frame is at its limit.	0									
1021012017	2	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	But your frame... I have never seen it before.	0									
1021012018	2	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Maybe this can be our chance.	0									
1021012019	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	What's this vibration...	3									
1021012020	1	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	Quick! Brace yourself for impact!	3									
1021012021	1	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	I failed again... Dammit!	3									
1021012022	2	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	(Tries to stand up)	0									
1021012023	2	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	This isn't the first time...	0									
1021012024	2	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	(Takes a deep breath)	0									
1021012025	2	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	We are missing some key information... Wait, could it be...?	0									
1021012026	1	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	We have to try something else.	3									
1021012027	1	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	It's okay. As long as we are still here, we have endless chances to keep trying.	3									
1021012028	1	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	We will open the paths to other key locations for you.	3									
1021012029	1	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	You must find the answer yourself.	3									
1021012030	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Where will the answer be this time...?	3									
1021012031	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Whatever awaits, I must keep going...!	3									
1021022000	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Is this the core supplying energy to the barrier?	0									
1021022001	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Shall I break it? Or...	0									
1021022002	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	I knew it... Part of this energy can be extracted.	0									
1021022003	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Now...	0									
1021022004	1	1	Tips	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	The platform below begins to tremble...	3									
1021022005	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Done.	3									
1021022006	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	"Is this a message... from ""me""?"	3									
1021022007	2	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	The time... and space... cross... Counting on... you...	0

1021022010	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Something isn't quite right...	0									
1021022011	2	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	The time and space will cross... Keep going...	0									
1021022012	2	1	Lee?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png	I'm counting on you... The other me...	0									
1021022013	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	I'll rewind the time!	3									
1021022014	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Now is the time... I'll stop the electromagnetic radiation eruption!	0									
1021022015	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Did it work...?	3									
1021011900	2	1	Chat Bot	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/BaixianshengNormal01.png	You look a bit anxious.	0

1021011910	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Better stick to the plan...	0									
1021011911	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	I might need to adjust the route...	3									
1021011912	2	1	Guard	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotinvNormal01.png	Thank goodness you are here, Lee. I came across a kid during my patrol. He and his brother were separated.	0

1021011930	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	It has a hollow base. I should probably flip it.	0									
1021011931	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Is that a... level one alert?	3

1021011938	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Is he that child's brother?	0									
1021011939	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Excuse me, can I borrow the phonograph...?	0									
1021011940	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	The message and coordinates...	0

1021011944	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	This area is getting unstable.	3									
1021011945	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Message delivered. There's nothing I can do here.	0									
1021011946	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Better leave before I interfere with this world's original track.	0									
1021011947	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	I did some quick treatments. Still, I suggest you let a doctor look at your wounds ASAP.	0									
1021011948	2	1	Injured Young Man	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal01.png	No worries. Thanks, Lee. I'm just a little curious... How did you find me?	0									
1021011949	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	I was tracking the signal launcher in the phonograph's base. But I didn't know it was you.	0									
1021011950	2	1	Injured Young Man	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal01.png	Phonograph? Launcher? What are you talking about...?	0

1021011955	2	1	Lost Child	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal02.png	Brother... You have so many wounds...	0									
1021011956	2	1	Injured Young Man	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal01.png	Don't worry. They don't hurt anymore.	0									
1021011957	2	1	Lost Child	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal02.png	You're lying! They must hurt a lot. I'll help you change the dressing when we get home.	0									
1021011958	2	1	Lost Child	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal02.png	I can take care of you too, Brother. I'm not a child anymore.	0									
1021011959	2	1	Injured Young Man	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal01.png	Haha, I see. My brother's grown up.	0									
1021011960	2	1	Injured Young Man	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal01.png	Alright, we'll see you then, Lee.	0									
1021011961	1	1	Injured Young Man	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal01.png	Oh, did you see my phonograph? I forgot where I put it...	3									
1021011962	1	1	Lost Child	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal02.png	Phonograph? Yeah. It was with the music bot.	3									
1021011963	2	1	Injured Young Man	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal01.png	Music bot? How weird. How did it end up there?	0									
1021011964	2	1	Lost Child	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal02.png	The bot probably found it somewhere and picked it up...	0									
1021011965	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	They remind me of the days with Murray...	3									
1021011966	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	"""Family is irreplaceable..."""	3									
1021011967	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	I've been caught up in all the missions and haven't talked with Murray much recently.	3									
1021011968	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png	Murray? Yeah, I'm still on the surface...	0									
1021011969	2	1	Lost Child	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal02.png	This is Brother's phonograph!	3									
1021012100	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	This abnormal space... Feels like a mixture of many different M.I.N.D.s of unknown origins.	0									
1021012101	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	I must break through this barrier while the space is still stable.	0									
1021012102	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	These barriers look a little similar to the one inside the tower.	0									
1021012103	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	If they are based on the same theory, maybe I can...	0									
1021012104	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	I knew it wouldn't be that easy.	3									
1021012105	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	"What if I try to reverse the ""time"" of this barrier?"	3									
1021012106	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Right here... I just need to adjust the power output...	0									
1021012107	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	That's what I thought...	0									
1021012108	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	It's a memory fragment, but some of its content is missing.	0

1022021407	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Alright... I'll analyze the landscape first.	0									
1022021408	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Here's a good spot for observation! I'll leave the rest to you, Sica.	0									
1022021409	2	1	Lena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200hyNormal01.png	I hope you weren't bragging.	0									
1022021410	1	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	I-I know!	3									
1022021411	1	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Activating holographic goggles.	3									
1022021412	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	There aren't many things that can be used as cover here...	0									
1022021413	2	1	Trojan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200tlyNormal01.png	That means the enemies won't come this way, right?	0									
1022021414	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	No, Hetero-Creatures only act on instinct. Which means...	0									
1022021415	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	The battle will likely take place here.	0									
1022021416	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Maybe we can take advantage of the height difference...	0									
1022021417	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	I know this tactic. Take the high ground!	0									
1022021418	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Um... That's one way to fight, but if we set up a feint attack to lure the enemy here...	0									
1022021419	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Maybe we can establish an even greater advantage.	0									
1022021420	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	That's enough information. I'm creating a tactic model now.	0									
1022021421	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	To protect our flanks, we must split into two groups... But if that's the case...	0									
1022021422	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	No need to worry too much, Sica. Just pick the plan that you think is the best. Leave the rest to us!	0									
1022021423	2	1	Trojan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200tlyNormal01.png	I hate trouble...	0									
1022021424	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Okay, got it. We need to secure both the left and right flanks, so we can help each other.	0									
1022021425	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Considering the right side would be facing a greater pressure, we should allocate our forces like this...	0									
1022021426	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Alternatively, we can set up an ambush at the central highland. But this is somehow passive...	0									
1022021427	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	I like it when everybody stays together to overcome the obstacle!	0									
1022021428	2	1	Lena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200hyNormal01.png	My bow will work better in this position.	0									
1022021429	2	1	Tips	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Which tactic would you choose?	0									
1022021430	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Let's split up just to be safe.	0									
1022021431	2	1	Jacqued	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Check your equipment. Get in position!	0									
1022021432	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Let's set up an ambush just to be safe.	0									
1022021433	2	1	Jacqued	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Check your equipment. Get in position!	0									
1022021434	1	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	I have already investigated the landscape here.	3									
1022021435	2	1	Morris	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Hey, don't run around. That's not our area to defend.	0									
1022021436	2	1	Jacqued	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Get yourself ready. According to the recon team, the Punishing creatures may come from any direction.	0									
1022021437	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	The position I need to take is...	0									
1022021438	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Wait a sec, Ayla. Something isn't right over there.	0									
1022021439	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Not good... Constructs may not be able to exploit this position, but Hetero-Creatures can easily break through from here!	0									
1022021440	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	How did you find out about this position, Sica?	0									
1022021441	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Because... I ran many simulations in the past, and some of them are quite similar to this one...	4									
1022021442	2	1	Lena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200hyNormal01.png	Your nerdiness ends up helping us after all.	4									
1022021443	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Just as I thought, if enemies ever show up here, we will be caught in a dangerously passive situation.	0									
1022021444	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Wouldn't that be a big problem to us?	0									
1022021445	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	There's a risk that we will face enemies from three directions.	0									
1022021446	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	...	0									
1022021447	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	We should gather our forces in a favorable position and wait for the enemies to come to us.	0									
1022021448	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Let's split into 3 groups!	0									
1022021449	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Lena stays in the middle, so she can support us from afar at any time...	0									
1022021450	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Trojan, please defend the left flank with Captain Jacqued because you will be facing the most enemies. Ayla, I need you to be ready to support them.	0									
1022021451	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Yes, Commandant!	0									
1022021452	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	The left flank will face many times the risk.	0									
1022021453	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	If the left is breached, the right side will be completely exposed.	0									
1022021454	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	That leaves us no time to help each other or retreat.	0									
1022021455	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	The risk of total failure is too high.	0									
1022021456	2	1	Trojan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200tlyNormal01.png	The enemies can literally come out from anywhere.	0									
1022021457	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	A failure on paper is not a real one. Let's rethink our strategy!	0									
1022021458	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	That's it!	0									
1022021459	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Yes, Commandant!	0									
1022021460	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Gather our forces in a favorable position.	0									
1022021461	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Let them come to us!	0									
1022021462	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Please get in position, Ayla.	0									
1022021463	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Leave it to us now!	0									
1022021464	2	1	Morris	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Morris in position.	3

1022021471	1	1	Jacqued	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Attack!	3

1022021474	1	1	Jacqued	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Ready to attack!	0									
1022021475	1	1	Jacqued	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Take this!	3									
1022021476	1	1	Jacqued	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Watch out! Grenade!	3									
1022021477	1	1	Morris	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	We need backup on the left!	3									
1022021478	1	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	On my way! Be right there!	3									
1022021479	1	1	Dreiser	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal04.png	We need backup on the right!	3									
1022021480	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	We should gather our forces in a favorable position.	0									
1022031400	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Now's not the time to go this way.	0									
1022031401	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	These people... Their names are all on the list of casualties.	0

1022031407	2	1	Lena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200hyNormal01.png	They gave their limbs to those who were still fighting... Even if that wouldn't change anything...	0									
1022031408	2	1	Trojan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200tlyNormal01.png	Sometimes people do things just for the sake of doing it.	0

1022031410	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	I see. He wants us to experience this battle in their perspective.	0

1022031412	1	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Is he pointing us the way?	4									
1022031413	1	1	Trojan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200tlyNormal01.png	I don't know your name, but thanks.	4									
1022031414	1	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Jacqued... Dreiser...	4									
1022031415	1	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	In that withdrawal... Many didn't make it till the launch of Longinus Arsenal.	4									
1022031416	1	1	Lena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200hyNormal01.png	They were staying behind to ensure Gray Raven could deliver the sample. Even without the incident, it was hardly possible for them to return unscathed.	4									
1022031417	1	1	Jacqued	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	What are you doing there?! Go to your defense position! The next wave of enemy is coming!	3									
1022031418	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	We have been sent back to the moment before the withdrawal started.	0									
1022031419	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	We need to know more about this timepoint...	0									
1022031420	2	1	Jacqued	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Get in your position!	0

1022031424	2	1	Leonard	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Someone told me humans would either go to heaven or hell after they die. I wonder where will Constructs go?	0									
1022031425	2	1	Charles	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	How long can we hold them for...? 5 minutes?	0

1022031427	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Ayla, Trojan, Lena... I want to do what I can.	0									
1022031428	2	1	Tips	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Start the simulation?	0									
1022031429	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	...I need to collect more information.	0									
1022031430	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	The objective is to cover those Constructs as they evacuate!	0									
1022031431	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	We need to stall the enemies as much as possible.	0									
1022031432	2	1	Lena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200hyNormal01.png	It's easy to say that... But no matter what plan you can come up with, we can't change what has already happened.	0									
1022031433	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	The majority of the enemies come from the Central Purification Filter.	3									
1022031434	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	With the ruins nearby, we can set up a temporary defense point here.	3									
1022031435	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	We can deploy our forces here and take advantage of the covers to hold the enemies off.	3									
1022031436	2	1	Lena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200hyNormal01.png	We are almost out of ammunition. Even if we gather all our forces here, it won't work.	0									
1022031437	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	C'mon Lena. Miracles won't happen if you give up before you start!	0									
1022031438	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	No, there's another way!	0									
1022031439	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	The strength of Hetero-Creatures lies in their numbers. If we can cut them off in the middle and send some people this way...	0									
1022031440	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Trojan is great at assault, so she can lead this team while Lena snipes from behind.	0									
1022031441	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	If the frontline forces can work with us, the Hetero-Creatures won't be able to focus on both ends. This should buy us some more time.	0									
1022031442	2	1	Lena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200hyNormal01.png	Wait... Maybe it actually will work?	0									
1022031443	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	The rest of the battle is straight forward. Let's go, Iris Warbler.	0									
1022031444	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Let's explain to Captain Jacqued.	0									
1022031445	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	I think we should send a team to flank the enemy from behind.	0									
1022031446	2	1	Jacqued	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Very bold idea... But it may work. I'll send someone to help you, so go for it.	0									
1022031447	2	1	Trojan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200tlyNormal01.png	Lena, you ready? Be careful not to shoot me.	0									
1022031448	2	1	Lena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200hyNormal01.png	You better be careful not to let any Hetero-Creature through.	0									
1022031449	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Ayla, I need you to defend this position... I'll stay with you too. Will this really work?	0									
1022031450	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Their destiny may already be determined, but Iris Warbler never gives up!	0									
1022031451	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Over there.	3									
1022031452	2	1	Jacqued	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	The frontline troops have engaged the enemies!	3									
1022031453	2	1	Jacqued	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Hold your ground until the main force has evacuated!	3									
1022031454	2	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	We await your order, Sica.	0									
1022031455	2	1	Lena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200hyNormal01.png	The decision is yours to make.	0									
1022031456	2	1	Trojan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200tlyNormal01.png	I'm counting on you, so better do a good job.	0									
1022031457	2	1	Sica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200xkNormal01.png	Attack! Now!	3									
1022031458	1	1	Jacqued	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Move the injured from position 1 to position 2. Where's the commando team?	3									
1022031459	1	1	Jacqued	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Enter the position! Hurry!	3									
1022031460	1	1	Jacqued	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal02.png	Great job, commando team! Now focus fire on these Hetero-Creatures.	3									
1022031461	3	1	Charles	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	...Holding position! I can still fight!	5									
1022031462	3	1	Morris	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal01.png	Almost there. Just a little longer, and we can go...	5

300317015	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR4Li1Q.png	I see. They are from the decorations... A very sophisticated design indeed.	5									
300317016	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR4Li1Q.png	Commandant, I believe we can draw reference from this device and prepare a proposal to reinforce the outer defense walls of conservation areas.	8									
300317017	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR4Li1Q.png	Commandant? Are you feeling alright?	3									
300317018	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR4Li1Q.png	The design of this hall is also well thought out. It can broadcast music to...	5									
300317019	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR4Li1Q.png	...Wait, what's this music?	3									
300317020	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR4Li1Q.png	...I would rather you take this time to have more rest.	3									
300317021	1	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR4Li1Q.png	...Forget about it. What's next? A photo together?	5

300317027	1	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR4LuxiyaQ.png	I have pressed the switch. Is the door open already?	3									
300317028	1	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR4LuxiyaQ.png	Commandant, this door is still locked.	3									
300317029	1	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR4LuxiyaQ.png	The door in front is still closed... What's going on?	3									
300317030	1	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR4LuxiyaQ.png	The wall is right behind me, Commandant.	3									
300317031	1	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR4LuxiyaQ.png	I'm unable to move back, Commandant. Should I break through the wall?	3									
300317032	1	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR4LuxiyaQ.png	Commandant? Hello? Is there a connection problem?	3									
300317033	1	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR4LuxiyaQ.png	...Commandant?	3									
300317034	1	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR4LuxiyaQ.png	Commandant, we are running out of time. Time to move on.	3									
300317035	1	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR4LuxiyaQ.png	Have we failed? Don't worry, Commandant, I have already remembered the routes. We will make it work the next time.	0									
300317036	1	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR4LuxiyaQ.png	Watch out, Commandant. You seem to be out of range. Stay closer to me.	0

300317041	1	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLifuSSQ.png	Commandant? Is everything alright? The door seems to be still closed.	3									
300317042	1	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLifuSSQ.png	The door is still locked. Can you find any switch on your side, Commandant?	3									
300317043	1	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLifuSSQ.png	There is no other path behind me, Commandant.	3									
300317044	1	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLifuSSQ.png	Commandant? Are we going back to the starting point?	3									
300317045	1	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLifuSSQ.png	Commandant...? Are you tired?	3									
300317046	1	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLifuSSQ.png	...You don't sound very well. Commandant, please don't push yourself too hard.	3									
300317047	1	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLifuSSQ.png	We can rest once we are out of the maze. Please keep going, Commandant.	3									
300317048	1	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLifuSSQ.png	I think we have failed... But don't worry, Commandant. I will always be by your side.	0

300317054	1	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadBiankaSSQ.png	The door is still locked, Commandant.	3									
300317055	1	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadBiankaSSQ.png	Is there any other mechanism nearby, Commandant?	3									
300317056	1	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadBiankaSSQ.png	There's no way behind me, Commandant.	3									
300317057	1	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadBiankaSSQ.png	Go back? Um... There is no way behind me, Commandant.	3									
300317058	1	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadBiankaSSQ.png	I await your instructions, Commandant.	3									
300317059	1	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadBiankaSSQ.png	Commandant? Is there an emergency?	3									
300317060	1	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadBiankaSSQ.png	We need to keep going, Commandant.	3									
300317061	1	1	Bianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadBiankaSSQ.png	There's no need to worry, Commandant. We still have lots of time.	0

300317067	1	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR5YongyechaoQ.png	The door's still locked— Keep working, Commandant!	3									
300317068	1	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR5YongyechaoQ.png	Huh? Commandant, can you hear me? The door on my side is still locked!	3									
300317069	1	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR5YongyechaoQ.png	Eh? There's no way behind me!	3									
300317070	1	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR5YongyechaoQ.png	There's no way behind... Shall I deploy Power to break the wall? I'm ready!	3									
300317071	1	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR5YongyechaoQ.png	Commandant? Is there another order? I'm about to go in!	3									
300317072	1	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR5YongyechaoQ.png	Commandant? Hmm? Did I just lose connection with you? C-o-m-m-a-n-d-a-n-t!	3									
300317073	1	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR5YongyechaoQ.png	Knock knock, Commandant, are you there? Time to go!	3									
300317074	1	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR5YongyechaoQ.png	What, did we fail? Cheer up, Commandant! We still have plenty of time. I'll always be with you!	0

300317077	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadShenweiQ.png	The door just opened! Thanks!	3									
300317078	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadShenweiQ.png	Is the door open on your side, Commandant?	3									
300317079	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadShenweiQ.png	Hah, found it! Here's the switch!	3									
300317080	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadShenweiQ.png	Commandant, this door is still locked.	3									
300317081	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadShenweiQ.png	Hmm... I can't seem to shake it open. Perhaps you still need to press some switch, Commandant.	3									
300317082	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadShenweiQ.png	There seems to be no other way behind... Do we have another option?	3									
300317083	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadShenweiQ.png	I'm already back to the starting point, Commandant.	3									
300317084	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadShenweiQ.png	Oh, I can see Commandant when I jump up! Hey! I'm still here!	3									
300317085	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadShenweiQ.png	Commandant— Where are you?	3									
300317086	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadShenweiQ.png	Why am I not hearing from you, Commandant? Commandant! We need to go!	3									
300317087	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadShenweiQ.png	Don't give up, Commandant! Let's do it again!	0									
300317088	1	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadShenweiQ.png	Whoa, Commandant, you are almost out of the circle! Stay closer!	0									
300317089	1	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR4KalieninaQ.png	The door's open, Commandant.	3									
300317090	1	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR4KalieninaQ.png	Hmm... The door's open, but the cables seem to be quite aged and loose. They need some maintenance.	3									
300317091	1	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR4KalieninaQ.png	Is the door open? I have already pressed the switch here.	3									
300317092	1	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR4KalieninaQ.png	...I have pressed the switch. Is the door open? ...Never mind, just checking because the switch was a little rusty.	3									
300317093	1	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR4KalieninaQ.png	...It doesn't seem to be a connection problem. Is there any switch you haven't pressed over there?	3									
300317094	1	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR4KalieninaQ.png	The door ahead is still locked. If there is nothing you can do, I'm going to break through with force—	3									
300317095	1	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR4KalieninaQ.png	Go back? There's no way back!	3									
300317096	1	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR4KalieninaQ.png	...I'm already at the starting point! Where else do you want me to go?!	3									
300317097	1	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR4KalieninaQ.png	Hello? Commandant? You better not be slacking off!	3									
300317098	1	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR4KalieninaQ.png	Why is this lifting device so noisy...?	3									
300317099	1	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR4KalieninaQ.png	Commandant? You aren't spacing out, are you? There's a fair bit of walk before the end point. Wake up!	3									
300317100	1	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR4KalieninaQ.png	It must be the aged circuit's problem! No way I would fail... Let's do it again! I will find out what's going on with this maze!	0									
300317101	1	1	Karenina	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR4KalieninaQ.png	Hey, stay closer to me. You are walking out of the circle!	0

300317105	1	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadDubianQ.png	Hmm... Here's a switch. Alright, is the door open over there?	3									
300317106	1	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadDubianQ.png	I can't move any further. The door is still locked. Can you check the surroundings?	3									
300317107	1	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadDubianQ.png	The door is still locked... Can you find any switch over there?	3									
300317108	1	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadDubianQ.png	...I'm already back to the starting point.	3									
300317109	1	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadDubianQ.png	There's no way behind. Do you have any other clue?	3									
300317110	1	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadDubianQ.png	Hmm? I can't hear anything. Are you too tired?	3									
300317111	1	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadDubianQ.png	Keep resting. You don't often get to rest like this.	3									
300317112	1	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadDubianQ.png	Shall we keep walking? We can take a good break after clearing this maze.	3									
300317113	1	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadDubianQ.png	Did we fail? That's okay. We still have plenty of time.	0									
300317114	1	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadDubianQ.png	Stay closer to me. You are about to move out of the circle.	0									
300317115	1	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR5Luxiya1Q.png	The door is open.	3									
300317116	1	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR5Luxiya1Q.png	It's open.	3									
300317117	1	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR5Luxiya1Q.png	Tch. Is it open yet?	3									
300317118	1	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR5Luxiya1Q.png	...So much trouble. Is the door open?	3									
300317119	1	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR5Luxiya1Q.png	Should I break this locked door apart?	3									
300317120	1	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR5Luxiya1Q.png	The door is locked. I assume you don't want me to rush to the maze's end yet.	3									
300317121	1	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR5Luxiya1Q.png	Back? There is no way back. What do you want me to do?	3									
300317122	1	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR5Luxiya1Q.png	I'm already at the starting point.	3									
300317123	1	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR5Luxiya1Q.png	Are you sure you want to leave an Ascendant here alone?	3									
300317124	1	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR5Luxiya1Q.png	You shouldn't be able to see what I'm doing here. If that's the case...	3									
300317125	1	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR5Luxiya1Q.png	Have you had enough rest already? I have no time to waste with you here. What's next?	3									
300317126	1	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR5Luxiya1Q.png	...Failed? Just do it again then.	0									
300317127	1	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR5Luxiya1Q.png	Stay closer to me, otherwise you will fail.	0									
300317128	1	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR3Aila1Q.png	Commandant, the door is open.	3									
300317129	1	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR3Aila1Q.png	The door's open! Just as I thought, there's always something new behind it.	3									
300317130	1	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR3Aila1Q.png	Here's a switch... Commandant? Is the door open?	3									
300317131	1	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR3Aila1Q.png	They put the switch in such a place... Watch out, Commandant. The door's about to open.	3									
300317132	1	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR3Aila1Q.png	The door is still locked, Commandant.	3									
300317133	1	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR3Aila1Q.png	I like the pattern on the door, but it's still locked, Commandant.	3									
300317134	1	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR3Aila1Q.png	...Do I still have to move back? I'm already at the starting point.	3									
300317135	1	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR3Aila1Q.png	There's no way behind me, Commandant.	3									
300317136	1	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR3Aila1Q.png	Tired? Shall we take a break together?	3									
300317137	1	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR3Aila1Q.png	A very special color... I wonder how they mixed it? Like this?	3									
300317138	1	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR3Aila1Q.png	Commandant? We need to keep going. There are more scenes to be seen in the maze.	3									
300317139	1	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR3Aila1Q.png	Failed? That's okay, I will stay here with you. Let me know anytime if you'd like to enter the maze again!	0

300317143	1	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSufeiyaQ.png	Is the door open on your side, Commandant?	3									
300317144	1	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSufeiyaQ.png	I have pressed the switch. Commandant, you should be able to move forward now.	3									
300317145	1	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSufeiyaQ.png	The door is still locked. Any other instructions, Commandant?	3									
300317146	1	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSufeiyaQ.png	The switch may be at your side, Commandant. Would you like to look around?	3									
300317147	1	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSufeiyaQ.png	There's no other way behind. Should I go from the ventilation pipe?	3

300317149	1	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSufeiyaQ.png	Hmm... This place... is different from the train.	3

300317151	1	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSufeiyaQ.png	It's time to keep moving, Commandant.	3									
300317152	1	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSufeiyaQ.png	It's okay, Commandant. I can come back with you many times.	0

300317156	1	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadKulomuQ.png	I just turned on the switch. Is the door open, Commandant?	3									
300317157	1	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadKulomuQ.png	Commandant, the door should be open by now. You can move forward.	3									
300317158	1	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadKulomuQ.png	Hmm... The door seems to be still locked. Maybe the switch is on your side, Commandant?	3									
300317159	1	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadKulomuQ.png	The door is still locked. Take a look at your surroundings, Commandant.	3									
300317160	1	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadKulomuQ.png	There's no other way behind, Commandant.	3									
300317161	1	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadKulomuQ.png	I'm back to where I started, Commandant.	3									
300317162	1	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadKulomuQ.png	Hmm... This operation has given me ideas for a new way of training...	3									
300317163	1	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadKulomuQ.png	Looking at this route... What if I modify the design and put in some traps? Oh, Commandant, I thought you weren't listening.	3									
300317164	1	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadKulomuQ.png	Commandant? Checking connection... All good. Shall we keep going? We haven't reached the end of the maze yet.	3									
300317165	1	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadKulomuQ.png	Failure means we are one step closer to success. Don't give up, Commandant. Shall we explore the maze again?	0									
300317166	1	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadKulomuQ.png	Commandant, I think you are leaving the circle. Please come closer.	0									
300317167	1	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWeilaQ.png	The door's open, what's next? Why is there still a long way ahead...	3									
300317168	1	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWeilaQ.png	Yeah, the door's open.	3									
300317169	1	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWeilaQ.png	The door should be open. Can you see it?	3									
300317170	1	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWeilaQ.png	What do I do with this thing... Okay, I pressed. Now what? Is the door open?	3									
300317171	1	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWeilaQ.png	Keep going? Do you want me to cut this locked door open?	3									
300317172	1	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWeilaQ.png	You're right, the door is still locked. Keep trying, C-o-m-m-a-n-d-a-n-t.	3									
300317173	1	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWeilaQ.png	...I'm already at the starting point. Do you want me to go out and leave you behind?	3									
300317174	1	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWeilaQ.png	There is no, way, behind.	3									
300317175	1	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWeilaQ.png	What a childish game... I don't mind playing it occasionally though.	3									
300317176	1	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWeilaQ.png	Hello...? How can you space out at such a time? What are you, a kid?	3									
300317177	1	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWeilaQ.png	If you keep zoning out, I'm going to cut this place apart and find you.	3									
300317178	1	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWeilaQ.png	Failed? I didn't expect that. But it's okay, I promised to finish this maze with you, and I will stay until we do.	0									
300317179	1	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWeilaQ.png	Hey, you are out of range. Are you trying to run away? Don't make me lock you up with a collar.	0									
300317180	1	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLunaQ.png	The door's already open.	3									
300317181	1	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLunaQ.png	The door just opened... So the switch was on your side.	3									
300317182	1	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLunaQ.png	I think I should press this switch... The door should be open now.	3									
300317183	1	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLunaQ.png	The door on your side should be open now.	3									
300317184	1	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLunaQ.png	I can't move forward. The door's still locked.	3									
300317185	1	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLunaQ.png	The door is still locked.	3									
300317186	1	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLunaQ.png	There is no other way back.	3									
300317187	1	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLunaQ.png	What are you doing? There's no way behind.	3									
300317188	1	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLunaQ.png	Is this what a maze is like...?	3									
300317189	1	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLunaQ.png	Where are you...?	3									
300317190	1	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLunaQ.png	There is a long way ahead. We must keep going.	3									
300317191	1	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLunaQ.png	Failed? That's okay. I will continue on this journey with you in the limited time we have.	0									
300317192	1	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLunaQ.png	Stay closer before the connection breaks.	0									
300317193	1	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadKamuQ.png	Let's keep going. The door on my side is open.	3									
300317194	1	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadKamuQ.png	The door's already open... Should I keep going?	3									
300317195	1	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadKamuQ.png	It really pisses me off that I can't see what's going on at your side... Is the door open yet?	3									
300317196	1	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadKamuQ.png	Here's a switch... Tch, what a boring little trick. Is the door open on your side?	3									
300317197	1	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadKamuQ.png	The door's still locked. Should I climb over?	3									
300317198	1	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadKamuQ.png	The door is quite strong... How about you keep looking for the switch?	3									
300317199	1	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadKamuQ.png	There's no way behind.	3									
300317200	1	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadKamuQ.png	Hey, I'm already at the starting point. There's no way back!	3									
300317201	1	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadKamuQ.png	Hmm... So it's really just a maze?	3									
300317202	1	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadKamuQ.png	You aren't daydreaming, are you? Why do you look so disoriented?	3									
300317203	1	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadKamuQ.png	Hey, can you hear me? There's still a long way in front. Wake up!	3									
300317204	1	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadKamuQ.png	Tch, that must be an accident. Let's do it again! I refuse to believe that we can't get past a small maze like this!	0									
300317205	1	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadKamuQ.png	Hey, don't go too far from me!	0									
300317206	1	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuosaitaQ.png	Thanks, Commandant. The door here is already open.	3									
300317207	1	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuosaitaQ.png	So the door needs to be open from the other side... It's open now. Thanks, Commandant.	3									
300317208	1	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuosaitaQ.png	There's nothing unusual nearby. Is the door open, Commandant?	3									
300317209	1	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuosaitaQ.png	...The door should be open now. The switch seems to be... still functioning?	3									
300317210	1	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuosaitaQ.png	Is the door jammed...? Hmm, don't think so. Commandant, can you look around a bit more?	3									
300317211	1	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuosaitaQ.png	The door's still locked, Commandant.	3									
300317212	1	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuosaitaQ.png	Um... There seems to be no way behind.	3									
300317213	1	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuosaitaQ.png	Commandant? There's no other way behind me. Any other instructions?	3									
300317214	1	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuosaitaQ.png	There are no broken buttons, or suddenly collapsed walls... I'm surprised.	3									
300317215	1	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuosaitaQ.png	Are you trying to take a break, Commandant?	3									
300317216	1	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuosaitaQ.png	Commandant? The end point should be right ahead. I need your instruction.	3									
300317217	1	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuosaitaQ.png	Um... Maybe my bad luck was haunting us. Can we try again, Commandant?	0									
300317218	1	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuosaitaQ.png	Ah, Commandant, please stay closer. You are about to move out of range.	0									
300317219	1	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadQuQ.png	Good job. The door's open.	3									
300317220	1	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadQuQ.png	The door's open. Very good.	3									
300317221	1	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadQuQ.png	Are you asking me to... press this switch?	3									
300317222	1	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadQuQ.png	...Nobody dared to make me open the door for them, except you.	3									
300317223	1	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadQuQ.png	Let me activate Lord of Kowloong's access... It didn't work? The door is still locked.	3									
300317224	1	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadQuQ.png	Who would have thought that I, the Lord of Kowloong, couldn't open this simple door...? What, the switch is on your side? Hmph...	3									
300317225	1	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadQuQ.png	I'm already at the starting point of this maze. Do you want me to go back to Kowloong instead?	3									
300317226	1	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadQuQ.png	I repeat, there is no way behind.	3									
300317227	1	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadQuQ.png	The design of this maze... is quite sophisticated.	3									
300317228	1	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadQuQ.png	Are you making me wait here for nothing? Only you have the guts to do this.	3									
300317229	1	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadQuQ.png	You invited me here, and left me here waiting? Get up. We haven't cleared the maze yet.	3									
300317230	1	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadQuQ.png	"""Failure"" is a word that will never be found in my dictionary. Keep going. I will conquer this place with you."	0									
300317231	1	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadQuQ.png	Stay closer. You are about to move out of the circle.	0									
300317232	1	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadChangYuQ.png	Wow! The door's open. How interesting.	3									
300317233	1	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadChangYuQ.png	The switch to the door here... How can it be at your side?	3									
300317234	1	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadChangYuQ.png	Hey! Is the door open?	3									
300317235	1	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadChangYuQ.png	Easy-peasy! Let's keep going!	3									
300317236	1	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadChangYuQ.png	I'll move forward... Oh, the door's still locked. Maybe you should keep looking around?	3									
300317237	1	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadChangYuQ.png	The door didn't open, nor did I find any switch nearby... Could it be at your side?	3									
300317238	1	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadChangYuQ.png	Huh? But I'm already at the starting point.	3									
300317239	1	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadChangYuQ.png	Go back...? I can only take a small step, because I'm already at the starting point.	3									
300317240	1	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadChangYuQ.png	What if we give this place a Kowloong theme...? Right, that theater play would fit just right!	3									
300317241	1	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadChangYuQ.png	Are there any other fun things to do...?	3									
300317242	1	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadChangYuQ.png	Hello? The connection seems to be working fine... Wake up, we still have more to go.	3									
300317243	1	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadChangYuQ.png	Oops, we failed... But that's okay. Let's do it again! There is still plenty of time!	0									
300317244	1	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadChangYuQ.png	Stay closer. The connection is about to break!	0									
300317245	1	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWanShiQ.png	Hmm... The door has opened.	3									
300317246	1	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWanShiQ.png	Um... Should I just keep going forward?	3									
300317247	1	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWanShiQ.png	I think I need to do this... Is the door open, Commandant?	3									
300317248	1	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWanShiQ.png	The door should have opened... What else should I do?	3									
300317249	1	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWanShiQ.png	The door... is still locked.	3									
300317250	1	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWanShiQ.png	I can't keep going. The door is still locked... Is the switch on your side, Commandant?	3									
300317251	1	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWanShiQ.png	I'm already back to the starting point...	3									
300317252	1	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWanShiQ.png	There seems to be no other way behind...	3									
300317253	1	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWanShiQ.png	Phew... Is it break time yet?	3									
300317254	1	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWanShiQ.png	Zzzzzzz...	3									
300317255	1	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWanShiQ.png	Are we still going ahead? Or shall we find a maintenance chamber to take a nap?	3									
300317256	1	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWanShiQ.png	Failed...? Hmm... No worries, I can still do it one more time with you... Sleep? I can do that later. You are more important after all.	0									
300317257	1	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWanShiQ.png	Stay close to me, Commandant. Once you are out of that circle, the connection will be lost.	0									
300317258	1	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSaiLinNaQ.png	The door is open, Conductor.	3									
300317259	1	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSaiLinNaQ.png	A very sophisticated design... Is it trying to tell us our heart is connected to the other person's hand?	3									
300317260	1	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSaiLinNaQ.png	Is the door open, Conductor?	3									
300317261	1	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSaiLinNaQ.png	When the door of my heart swings wide, dusk and evening stars collide... Is the door open, Conductor?	3									
300317262	1	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSaiLinNaQ.png	Conductor... Are you trying to tell me our hearts can connect to each other even without a passage?	3									
300317263	1	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSaiLinNaQ.png	The door has not opened yet. Check your surroundings, Conductor.	3									
300317264	1	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSaiLinNaQ.png	My journey has returned to its starting point, but the finale to our melody is yet to be found...	3									
300317265	1	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSaiLinNaQ.png	Ah, Conductor, what I wanted to say was... There's no way behind.	3									
300317266	1	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSaiLinNaQ.png	I like this place, but I guess I enjoy spending time with you more, Conductor...	3									
300317267	1	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSaiLinNaQ.png	Though we are apart in sight, our souls stand close together.	3									
300317268	1	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSaiLinNaQ.png	Conductor? I yearn to pass time with you like this... But I still long to see your face.	3									
300317269	1	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSaiLinNaQ.png	Worry not, Conductor, for I will stay by your side even amidst a storm. Let's embark on this journey again, and together we will prevail.	0									
300317270	1	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSaiLinNaQ.png	Conductor? Please stay closer... Don't let our connection break.	0									
300317271	1	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHead21HaoQ.png	Okay, the door is open.	3									
300317272	1	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHead21HaoQ.png	Commandant, the door is open.	3									
300317273	1	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHead21HaoQ.png	Is this the switch that controls the door on your side, Commandant?	3									
300317274	1	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHead21HaoQ.png	No danger sighted... I have turned on the switch. Is the door open, Commandant?	3									
300317275	1	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHead21HaoQ.png	Sniff... The door didn't open. Is there any other way?	3									
300317276	1	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHead21HaoQ.png	There's no way ahead... The door didn't open either.	3									
300317277	1	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHead21HaoQ.png	I'm going to leave the maze if I keep going back.	3									
300317278	1	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHead21HaoQ.png	There's no way behind, Commandant.	3									
300317279	1	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHead21HaoQ.png	Sniff... It's Commandant's smell. Commandant is right there.	3									
300317280	1	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHead21HaoQ.png	If I climb to the top of the pillar... I'll be able to see Commandant.	3									
300317281	1	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHead21HaoQ.png	Hmm... Hello? Hello? Did the connection drop out? I can't hear Commandant...	3									
300317282	1	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHead21HaoQ.png	Failed...? That's okay. Commandant, I can play this with you once again, or many times more.	0									
300317283	1	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHead21HaoQ.png	Commandant... Commandant? Stay closer... The connection is about to break.	0									
300317284	1	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuolanQnew.png	The door is open... What an amazing feeling.	3									
300317285	1	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuolanQnew.png	Hmm... Is this how the door is controlled? The switch on your side will operate my door?	3									
300317286	1	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuolanQnew.png	Here's a switch... Hey, is the door open over there?	3									
300317287	1	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuolanQnew.png	Will you stay in this maze forever if I don't open this door? Aha, I was just kidding, of course.	3									
300317288	1	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuolanQnew.png	Should I talk to this door to make it open by itself?	3									
300317289	1	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuolanQnew.png	The door didn't open. Should I do something else to it?	3									
300317290	1	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuolanQnew.png	"""O dear Commandant, I have no way back..."" I really mean it."	3									
300317291	1	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuolanQnew.png	Should I greet you while standing on a pillar at the starting point?	3									
300317292	1	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuolanQnew.png	Entrusting my path to someone else... is surprisingly fun.	3									
300317293	1	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuolanQnew.png	"What a special ""maze""... Now I'm looking forward to the moment we meet."	3									
300317294	1	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuolanQnew.png	Um-hum? Are you actually spacing out? Aren't you worried that I might do something to this maze? Keep going. I look forward to seeing your face.	3									
300317295	1	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuolanQnew.png	Failed? Isn't it normal? Of course, I will stay with you until you successfully clear the maze.	0									
300317296	1	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuolanQnew.png	The connection is about to break. Do you hate to stay near me that much?	0									
300317297	1	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadPulaoQnew.png	Wow! It actually opened!	3

300317299	1	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadPulaoQnew.png	Should I press this switch...? Hey! Is the door open on your side, Commandant?	3									
300317300	1	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadPulaoQnew.png	Hmm... Found it! Here's the switch!	3									
300317301	1	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadPulaoQnew.png	Huh? The door hasn't opened yet. Can you keep looking around, Commandant?	3									
300317302	1	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadPulaoQnew.png	The switch isn't here... Keep looking around, Commandant!	3									
300317303	1	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadPulaoQnew.png	Back... There is no way back. Commandant, can you find any other ways?	3									
300317304	1	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadPulaoQnew.png	There's no way behind me. There should be another path... Right, Commandant?	3									
300317305	1	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadPulaoQnew.png	Left, right, left, right... Gargh! I can't remember the route at all!	3									
300317306	1	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadPulaoQnew.png	I wonder what the end point will look like...	3									
300317307	1	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadPulaoQnew.png	Commandant—? Are you still there? Hello? There's still a long way to go!	3									
300317308	1	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadPulaoQnew.png	Failed... But that's okay! As long as I'm with Commandant, I can be braver than ever! Let's do it again, Commandant!	0									
300317309	1	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadPulaoQnew.png	Hey, Commandant, come closer! You are walking out of the circle!	0									
300317310	1	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	The door here is open, Commandant.	3									
300317311	1	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	The door is open. Thanks, Commandant.	3									
300317312	1	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Commandant, I have pressed the switch. You can go.	3									
300317313	1	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	The switch has been activated. Commandant, please move forward as soon as possible.	3									
300317314	1	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Commandant, the switch to this door should be on your side.	3									
300317315	1	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Please turn on the switch on your side so I can move forward.	3									
300317316	1	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	There is no other way behind. Should I leave the maze and enter again?	3									
300317317	1	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	No route detected behind.	3

300317320	1	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Commandant, the break time is over. According to the maze procedures, we must continue moving forward.	3									
300317321	1	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Commandant, my calculation indicates our chance to clear this maze in the next attempt is 99.89%. I'm ready when you are.	0									
300317322	1	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Commandant, please stay close to me. You have walked out of the circle.	0

300317324	1	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadNuoanQnew.png	The door is open on my side. I'll be there soon.	3									
300317325	1	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadNuoanQnew.png	For a switch like this, I only need to punch it like what we always do in the Inspection Team... Just kidding. Is the door open, Commandant?	3									
300317326	1	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadNuoanQnew.png	The door is open. Come, I'm waiting for you.	3									
300317327	1	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadNuoanQnew.png	Commandant? The door ahead is still locked. Do you need help?	3									
300317328	1	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadNuoanQnew.png	The switch to open this door should be near you. Can you look around?	3									
300317329	1	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadNuoanQnew.png	There's no way behind. Let's look for a solution together.	3									
300317330	1	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadNuoanQnew.png	The fun of exploration comes from discovering other different routes. Let's try again.	3									
300317331	1	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadNuoanQnew.png	A place like this means warm spring is just around the corner. Is that something you look forward to?	3									
300317332	1	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadNuoanQnew.png	Commandant— Hmm... Commandant? I'm okay, don't worry. I just realized sometimes you would give me interesting responses when I called you in a different tone.	3									
300317333	1	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadNuoanQnew.png	Tired? Just take a break if you need to. I don't have any plans, so I can stay here till you feel better.	3									
300317334	1	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadNuoanQnew.png	We didn't reach the end, but the information collected will help us in the next attempt. Let's do it again.	0									
300317335	1	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadNuoanQnew.png	Don't go too far from me, Commandant. Stay within the circle.	0									
300317336	1	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Bangbinata1Q.png	Commandant, the door is open.	3									
300317337	1	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Bangbinata1Q.png	Roger that. Moving through the door.	3									
300317338	1	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Bangbinata1Q.png	The switch has been activated. Your command is executed.	3									
300317339	1	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Bangbinata1Q.png	Roger. Should I just press the switch like this?	3									
300317340	1	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Bangbinata1Q.png	Moving forward... Ouch. I-I just hit the door.	3									
300317341	1	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Bangbinata1Q.png	The door is still locked. I request permission for the weapon system to open this door.	3									
300317342	1	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Bangbinata1Q.png	Moving back... Ouch! I'm already leaning on a pillar...	3									
300317343	1	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Bangbinata1Q.png	Bambinata is already at the starting point. Should I return from the maze?	3									
300317344	1	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Bangbinata1Q.png	Hmm, no new order received...	3									
300317345	1	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Bangbinata1Q.png	Hmm? Why am I doing this... There is no related memory data in my M.I.N.D...	3									
300317346	1	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Bangbinata1Q.png	Commandant... Are you resting? Do you need anything from Bambinata? Um... What should Bambinata do...?	3									
300317347	1	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Bangbinata1Q.png	Failed... Did Bambinata fail to execute Commandant's order? No? Then... Shall we try again? I must clear the maze this time...	0									
300317348	1	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Bangbinata1Q.png	Please stay closer to Bambinata. Um... The connection is about to drop out...	0									
300317349	1	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Hanying1Q.png	The door here is open.	3									
300317350	1	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Hanying1Q.png	The door is open. What a delicate design.	3									
300317351	1	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Hanying1Q.png	Hmm... Is this how I should do it?	3									
300317352	1	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Hanying1Q.png	The door should be open. Can you see it? I think I just heard the spinning and turning sound of some machinery.	3									
300317353	1	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Hanying1Q.png	Keep going? But there is no way in front, Commandant.	3									
300317354	1	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Hanying1Q.png	Is there another switch on your side? The door is still locked.	3									
300317355	1	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Hanying1Q.png	Hmm... I can't see any path behind me. Should I look for other ways?	3									
300317356	1	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Hanying1Q.png	Should I keep moving backward? There is no way behind me.	3

300317359	1	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Hanying1Q.png	Commandant? Do you need a break? Or... Shall we clear this maze first?	3									
300317360	1	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Hanying1Q.png	It's okay, Commandant, we still have plenty of time. Let's do it again. I will always be here.	0

300317430	1	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLifuSSQ.png	To let partners feel that experience in advance...	0

300317475	1	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadDubianQ.png	There is something else we have in common.	0									
300317476	1	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadDubianQ.png	Where does this road lead?	0									
300317477	1	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadDubianQ.png	It's been a long time since I last saw something like this.	0									
300317478	1	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadDubianQ.png	Scenes like this always remind me of the past...	0									
300317479	1	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadDubianQ.png	Yeah... A very long time.	0									
300317480	1	1	Watanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadDubianQ.png	Is that the stage you mentioned? Let's check it out together.	0									
300317481	1	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR5Luxiya1Q.png	Luna will probably like this kind of place.	0									
300317482	1	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR5Luxiya1Q.png	But I prefer the vast, wild nature.	0									
300317483	1	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR5Luxiya1Q.png	"True. In a way, it was quite a special ""entertainment"" experience."	0									
300317484	1	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR5Luxiya1Q.png	It's not a matter of whether I like it or not.	0									
300317485	1	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR5Luxiya1Q.png	"I just have no intention of engaging in such ""entertainment."""	0									
300317486	1	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR5Luxiya1Q.png	I would probably never enter a place like this if you didn't reach out to me.	0									
300317487	1	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR5Luxiya1Q.png	Still... We worked together pretty well.	0									
300317488	1	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR5Luxiya1Q.png	Hmph, understanding your opponent is a crucial part of preparation for battle.	0									
300317489	1	1	α	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR5Luxiya1Q.png	Don't expect me to go easy on you on a real battlefield just because of that.	0									
300317490	1	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR3Aila1Q.png	This maze is so fun! Don't you think, Commandant?	0									
300317491	1	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR3Aila1Q.png	I love its design! The beach, the sea, and the maze!	0									
300317492	1	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR3Aila1Q.png	Even though it's a virtual hall, I still feel like I can smell the sea breeze.	0									
300317493	1	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR3Aila1Q.png	I know, right? It wasn't my delusion!	0									
300317494	1	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR3Aila1Q.png	Also, look at that design over there...	0									
300317495	1	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR3Aila1Q.png	Pink corals! I have never seen corals like those!	0									
300317496	1	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR3Aila1Q.png	This maze is just like what I have imagined!	0									
300317497	1	1	Ayla	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR3Aila1Q.png	Hmm... I just thought of an idea for the design of a new coating! Would you like to hear it, Commandant?	0									
300317498	1	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSufeiyaQ.png	...	0									
300317499	1	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSufeiyaQ.png	Oh, sorry. I was just thinking of some things on the train.	0									
300317500	1	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSufeiyaQ.png	"This set of corridors with the name of ""maze"" feels similar to the place where I once lived."	0									
300317501	1	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSufeiyaQ.png	But it gives me... a completely different feeling.	0									
300317502	1	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSufeiyaQ.png	Back there, it was always dark. I heard mice squeaking every day.	0									
300317503	1	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSufeiyaQ.png	But here is just... different.	0									
300317504	1	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSufeiyaQ.png	Hmm... I don't really know how to describe this feeling.	0									
300317505	1	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSufeiyaQ.png	Is that so...	0									
300317506	1	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSufeiyaQ.png	This place makes me happy indeed.	0									
300317507	1	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSufeiyaQ.png	I like it very much.	0									
300317508	1	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSufeiyaQ.png	What shall we do next?	0									
300317509	1	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR3KuluomuQ.png	I never thought we would go through a maze like this...	0									
300317510	1	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR3KuluomuQ.png	It was a form of entertainment, but I still learned a lot from the process.	0									
300317511	1	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR3KuluomuQ.png	Thanks for your instructions, Commandant.	0									
300317512	1	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR3KuluomuQ.png	I think I can draw some insights that can be used in the training of teamwork.	0									
300317513	1	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR3KuluomuQ.png	Maintaining the same distance from teammates is also a crucial skill needed in battles.	0									
300317514	1	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR3KuluomuQ.png	I'm sure it will benefit us.	0									
300317515	1	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR3KuluomuQ.png	I always knew I would learn a lot from you, Commandant.	0									
300317516	1	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR3KuluomuQ.png	After I go back, I will review the notes I took and discuss with you again, Commandant.	0									
300317517	1	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWeilaQ.png	Tch. Your instructions were not too bad.	0									
300317518	1	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWeilaQ.png	I'll give you a pass.	0									
300317519	1	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWeilaQ.png	Are you seriously complimenting me?	0									
300317520	1	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWeilaQ.png	...What a fool.	0									
300317521	1	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWeilaQ.png	Is there anything else I can expect?	0									
300317522	1	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWeilaQ.png	I thought we would see a minotaur or something like that after entering the maze.	0									
300317523	1	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWeilaQ.png	But there was nothing!	0									
300317524	1	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWeilaQ.png	I was expecting a decent fight.	0									
300317525	1	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWeilaQ.png	"Turns out it was just a game to ""test our synergy""?"	0									
300317526	1	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWeilaQ.png	...I can hardly imagine such a boring life.	0									
300317527	1	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWeilaQ.png	What's that? A stage?	0									
300317528	1	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLunaQ.png	...So this maze has a beach theme.	0									
300317529	1	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLunaQ.png	...	0									
300317530	1	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLunaQ.png	Some things from the past.	0									
300317531	1	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLunaQ.png	...Maybe.	0									
300317532	1	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLunaQ.png	But who can define what's happy, and what's not?	0									
300317533	1	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLunaQ.png	...	0									
300317534	1	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLunaQ.png	Are you feeling sorry for me?	0									
300317535	1	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLunaQ.png	What's at the end of this road?	0									
300317536	1	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLunaQ.png	All that effort to pass the maze just to reach the final stage?	0									
300317537	1	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLunaQ.png	...	0									
300317538	1	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLunaQ.png	...You humans always enjoy doing such meaningless things.	0									
300317539	1	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLunaQ.png	...Let's go. The stage is just in front.	0									
300317540	1	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadKamuQ.png	...Is that all?	0									
300317541	1	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadKamuQ.png	Humans of the Golden Age really had no better way of celebrating.	0									
300317542	1	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadKamuQ.png	Shouldn't there be some delicious food at the end of the maze?	0									
300317543	1	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadKamuQ.png	...Whatever you say.	0									
300317544	1	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadKamuQ.png	Anyway, I think we worked together pretty well just now.	0									
300317545	1	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadKamuQ.png	It's been a long time since we last connected, but the synergy's still there.	0									
300317546	1	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadKamuQ.png	...Hmph.	0									
300317547	1	1	Camu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadKamuQ.png	What's on the platform behind? Can I open those boxes?	0									
300317548	1	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuosaitaQ.png	It went surprisingly smoothly...	0									
300317549	1	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuosaitaQ.png	I feel like I'm always lucky when I'm with you, Commandant.	0									
300317550	1	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuosaitaQ.png	Do you have a special power?	0									
300317551	1	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuosaitaQ.png	...Pff.	0									
300317552	1	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuosaitaQ.png	I didn't expect that joke from you, Commandant.	0									
300317553	1	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuosaitaQ.png	But this maze is different from what we had in ARU...	0									
300317554	1	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuosaitaQ.png	We usually refer to forests with complex terrain as mazes.	0									
300317555	1	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuosaitaQ.png	The atmosphere is very different from this place, but still quite fun...	0									
300317556	1	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuosaitaQ.png	What's that in front... A stage?	0									
300317557	1	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuosaitaQ.png	We don't have such a thing in our maze...	0									
300317558	1	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuosaitaQ.png	Let's check it out together, Commandant.	0									
300317559	1	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadQuQ.png	Quite an interesting design.	0									
300317560	1	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadQuQ.png	"You are my ""partner"" now. Of course I will adjust my pace for you."	0									
300317561	1	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadQuQ.png	Spring... Kowloong also used to have some customs for this season.	0									
300317562	1	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadQuQ.png	In Kowloong, we would go for a spring outing and make seasonal dishes instead of navigating through a maze like this one.	0									
300317563	1	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadQuQ.png	Perhaps Tabula Akasha should also take in this different custom.	0									
300317564	1	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadQuQ.png	A stage? Will there be any performance?	0									
300317565	1	1	Qu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadQuQ.png	Feelings... Hah, let's check it out.	0									
300317566	1	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadChangYuQ.png	Hey! This place is great.	0									
300317567	1	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadChangYuQ.png	Have you ever thought about selling tickets and inviting people from other places?	0									
300317568	1	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadChangYuQ.png	I'm sure a lot of people will be interested!	0									
300317569	1	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadChangYuQ.png	Let me think. We can also change it to other themes...	0									
300317570	1	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadChangYuQ.png	Would you like to do this business with me? I'll give you 70% of the income!	0									
300317571	1	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadChangYuQ.png	Guess I'll need to talk to Babylonia then...	0									
300317572	1	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadChangYuQ.png	Hmm? I just like new stuff.	0									
300317573	1	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadChangYuQ.png	What's that in front? A stage?	0									
300317574	1	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadChangYuQ.png	Are we going to the souvenir shop already?	0									
300317575	1	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWanShiQ.png	Hmm... This place is perfect for sniping.	0									
300317576	1	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWanShiQ.png	If I can nap, I mean, ambush at the corner earlier...	0									
300317577	1	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWanShiQ.png	Hm...	0									
300317578	1	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWanShiQ.png	No, but I just feel this entire atmosphere...	0									
300317579	1	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWanShiQ.png	Is perfect for taking a rest...	0									
300317580	1	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWanShiQ.png	It will be great if we can put a maintenance chamber here.	0									
300317581	1	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWanShiQ.png	That will give me excellent sleep quality. Only that training room can beat it...	0									
300317582	1	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWanShiQ.png	Yawn...	0									
300317583	1	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWanShiQ.png	Okay... I won't. I can see the stage ahead.	0									
300317584	1	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWanShiQ.png	There's got to be some other activities...	0									
300317585	1	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadWanShiQ.png	I'll stay awake till the end...	0									
300317586	1	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSaiLinNaQ.png	~I do hear the morning lark...~	0									
300317587	1	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSaiLinNaQ.png	~Trip we after the night's shade...~	0									
300317588	1	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSaiLinNaQ.png	"""A Midsummer Night's Dream"", a beautiful opera."	0									
300317589	1	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSaiLinNaQ.png	It's a story about a beautiful forest, dusk and nightfall, and lovers finally live happily ever after.	0									
300317590	1	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSaiLinNaQ.png	Some couples fall in love with each other, while some are left in vain and despair.	0									
300317591	1	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSaiLinNaQ.png	It starts with mischievous fairies and concludes with a happy ending, in which the lovers rejoice and unite.	0									
300317592	1	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSaiLinNaQ.png	Like a torch in the dark night...	0									
300317593	1	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSaiLinNaQ.png	Oh... My apologies, I'm rambling on and on about my interests again.	0									
300317594	1	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSaiLinNaQ.png	That's excellent news. I will make sure to invite you to watch this opera if there is a chance, Conductor.	0									
300317595	1	1	Selena	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadSaiLinNaQ.png	I'll make sure to perform on that day...	0									
300317596	1	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHead21HaoQ.png	...Sniff, sniff.	0									
300317597	1	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHead21HaoQ.png	It's the real Gray Raven Commandant. Alarm disengaged.	0									
300317598	1	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHead21HaoQ.png	I must take caution in places that I have never been before.	0									
300317599	1	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHead21HaoQ.png	...Sniff, sniff.	0									
300317600	1	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHead21HaoQ.png	It's rare for me to see these colors.	0									
300317601	1	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHead21HaoQ.png	"I neither ""like"" nor ""dislike"" them."	0									
300317602	1	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHead21HaoQ.png	"Do you ""like"" this place, Commandant?"	0									
300317603	1	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHead21HaoQ.png	Noted. Gray Raven Commandant likes pink and blue.	0									
300317604	1	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHead21HaoQ.png	What do we do next?	0									
300317605	1	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHead21HaoQ.png	Hmm... I don't understand.	0									
300317606	1	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuolanQnew.png	Hah, who would have thought I had great synergy with a commandant?	0									
300317607	1	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuolanQnew.png	How interesting. It just reminds me of some things...	0									
300317608	1	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuolanQnew.png	That took place a long time ago.	0									
300317609	1	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuolanQnew.png	I like the form of this game... Very interesting.	0									
300317610	1	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuolanQnew.png	Are we playing puppets? Or marionettes?	0									
300317611	1	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuolanQnew.png	Controlling each other over a string of words...	0									
300317612	1	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuolanQnew.png	Should I thank you for inviting me to this excellent show?	0									
300317613	1	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuolanQnew.png	Hahahahaha, that's the Gray Raven Commandant I know.	0									
300317614	1	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuolanQnew.png	What's next? Any more interesting activities?	0									
300317615	1	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuolanQnew.png	Or... Is it time to say goodbye already?	0									
300317616	1	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuolanQnew.png	That would be a shame though.	0									
300317617	1	1	Roland	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLuolanQnew.png	After all...	0									
300317618	1	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadPulaoQnew.png	What a fun maze!	0									
300317619	1	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadPulaoQnew.png	It reminds me of the bagua maze recorded in Kowloong documents!	0									
300317620	1	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadPulaoQnew.png	But the bagua maze should be a little larger though?	0									
300317621	1	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadPulaoQnew.png	I feel like I'm always so happy when I'm with you, Commandant!	0									
300317622	1	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadPulaoQnew.png	Hehe. We had great coordination too!	0									
300317623	1	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadPulaoQnew.png	Turn left, turn right, then move ahead! Hehe!	0									
300317624	1	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadPulaoQnew.png	Whoa! I see a beach over there!	0									
300317625	1	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadPulaoQnew.png	I have always been living on the Nighter, but rarely saw a beach like this!	0

300317627	1	1	Pulao	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadPulaoQnew.png	Hooray!	0									
300317628	1	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	"Is this what you meant by ""explore""?"	0									
300317629	1	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	"Adding a new definition of ""explore"" to the database... Done."	0									
300317630	1	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Before we entered, I scanned the structure's interior and detected the optimal route.	0									
300317631	1	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	Still, there was some data I was unable to confirm when I went through the structure with you.	0									
300317632	1	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	"Just now, my database was occupied by the thought that I ""wanted"" to see you."	0									
300317633	1	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	But the reason behind this idea remains unclear to me.	0									
300317634	1	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	I have examined all my actions after entering the maze. Yet, I could not reach an answer.	0									
300317635	1	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	I will save this maze run in my memory.	0									
300317636	1	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadHakamaQnew.png	It will be stored along with all the data related to you for further analysis.	0									
300317637	1	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadNuoanQnew.png	We have reached the end point.	0									
300317638	1	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadNuoanQnew.png	True. It was our first time working together...	0									
300317639	1	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadNuoanQnew.png	Have you been deliberately trying to work with me, or do we just happen to have good synergy?	0									
300317640	1	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadNuoanQnew.png	True. I couldn't advance on my own if you weren't there.	0									
300317641	1	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadNuoanQnew.png	This maze was intended for the two participants to reach the end together.	0									
300317642	1	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadNuoanQnew.png	Sure. There's a stage ahead. I wonder what we will see there. Perhaps a ball or some other performance?	0									
300317643	1	1	Noan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadNuoanQnew.png	Let's check it out together, Commandant.	0									
300317644	1	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Bangbinata1Q.png	Commandant! Is there a new order?	0									
300317645	1	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Bangbinata1Q.png	New order accepted. Following Commandant.	0									
300317646	1	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Bangbinata1Q.png	It was very complicated.	0									
300317647	1	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Bangbinata1Q.png	Without Commandant's instructions or radar scanning...	0									
300317648	1	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Bangbinata1Q.png	Bambinata would never be able to clear this maze alone.	0									
300317649	1	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Bangbinata1Q.png	Bambinata will remember it.	0									
300317650	1	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Bangbinata1Q.png	Please give me an order with no time limit.	0									
300317651	1	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Bangbinata1Q.png	So Bambinata can read it again from the external module if it is ever forgotten.	0									
300317652	1	1	Bambinata	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Bangbinata1Q.png	The maze could not be cleared without the joint effort of Commandant and Bambinata. Bambinata will remember it.	0									
300317653	1	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Hanying1Q.png	It was a fantastic journey indeed.	0									
300317654	1	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Hanying1Q.png	Did you enjoy yourself, Commandant?	0									
300317655	1	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Hanying1Q.png	It feels like a spring outing that I read in the stories.	0									
300317656	1	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Hanying1Q.png	"The maze is quite sophisticated too. Kowloong also has a similar design... I think the name is ""bagua maze."""	0									
300317657	1	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Hanying1Q.png	Hmm... Would you like to come to Kowloong after this, Commandant?	0									
300317658	1	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Hanying1Q.png	It's a completely different vibe compared to this place. I'm sure you would like it.	0									
300317659	1	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Hanying1Q.png	I can be your guide to take you through the beautiful sceneries of Kowloong.	0									
300317660	1	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Hanying1Q.png	You will find ancient trees so tall that they can almost reach the sky, meandering streams, towering temples located on mountain peaks, as well as elevated paths built along cliffs.	0									
300317661	1	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Hanying1Q.png	Shall we make that a promise?	0									
300317662	1	1	Hanying	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadR2Hanying1Q.png	Is that a... stage in front?	0									
300317663	1	1	Dottie	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131bzNormal01.png	Do you want Mother's love? Very good.	3									
300317664	1	1	Dottie	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V131bzNormal01.png	Mother expects more than that.	3

300317677	2	1	Celica	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SailikaNomal01.png	Why is there no damage?	3									
300317678	2	1	Fu Shen	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/FushenNomal01.png	You can't hurt me.	3

1502050403	2	1	Scavenger A	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal01.png	I don't know. The performer mechanoids were functioning normally. But the moment I turned around, they turned mad and began to attack us.	0

2100025202	2	1	Tips	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	This device is unable to detect the exact location of enemy combat units and is hence unable to launch precise attacks.	0									
2100025203	2	1	Instructor	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Correct. Well done. Next, you need to hold off enemy units while ensuring the defense device can be booted successfully.	0									
2100025204	2	1	Instructor	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Even Engineering Force Constructs still need to possess a certain level of combat abilities.	0

2100025211	2	1	Instructor	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Here comes the final session, in which you will need to demonstrate your ability to use the device.	0									
2100025212	2	1	Instructor	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	To pass the test, you need to use the device correctly and incorporate your own combat techniques to eliminate all the enemy units.	0									
2100025220	2	1	Instructor	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Incorrect. The next phase will start. You need to hold off the enemy units and ensure the remaining two defense devices can start properly.	0									
2100025221	2	1	Instructor	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	With only two devices running, their overall capability will be limited, which means the difficulty of this session will significantly increase.	0

2100025227	2	1	Instructor	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	You need to use the device correctly and incorporate your own combat techniques to eliminate all the enemy units. This is your last chance to pass the test.	0

1502061404	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaSNormal01.png	Just don't freak out later.	0									
1502061410	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaSNormal01.png	No. 21, check the casualties.	0									
1502061411	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaSNormal01.png	I'll remain on guard.	0									
1502061412	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaSNormal01.png	Something's not right.	0									
1502061413	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaSNormal01.png	No. 21, go check the casualties.	0									
1502061414	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaSNormal01.png	Then ask that Dylan guy about the mammoth.	0									
1502061415	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaSNormal01.png	I'll stay on guard in case anything happens again.	0									
1502061416	2	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Twentyone1.png	Understood.	0									
1502061420	2	1	Dylan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal01.png	Thanks for saving my life.	0									
1502061421	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaSNormal01.png	Is that so? I thought you promised to give the house to me?	0									
1502061422	2	1	Dylan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal01.png	Ahem... Of course I want to give it to you. But as you can see, the best one is already burned to the ground.	0									
1502061423	2	1	Resident	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal01.png	****! This is just one of the many houses you have!	0									
1502061424	2	1	Dylan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal01.png	Um...	0									
1502061425	2	1	No. 21	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Twentyone1.png	So many houses. I can play hide-and-seek for ages in them...	0									
1502061426	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaSNormal01.png	Tch, as if I really care about your house. Back to the point, what's with these stupid monstrosities?	0									
1502061427	2	1	Dylan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal01.png	The moment I stepped out of the town... I saw several mammoths... About three, maybe?	0									
1502061428	2	1	Dylan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal01.png	They started to chase after me before I could figure out what was happening.	0									
1502061429	2	1	Dylan	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal01.png	I had no choice but to run back. Fortunately, you were here...	0									
1502061430	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaSNormal01.png	We only have one here. So there's another two more coming.	0									
1502061431	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaSNormal01.png	But this place can't withstand any more battles.	0									
1502061432	2	1	Resident	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal01.png	I can set up explosives in front of the mayor's home. We just need to get the mammoths to go there.	0									
1502061433	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaSNormal01.png	Alright. I'll get them here.	0									
1502061434	2	1	Vera	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/WeilaSNormal01.png	No. 21, you take these people with you. Leave this place to me.	0

1502061202	2	1	Fann	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V240fnNormal01.png	I'm fine. Thanks for saving me.	0									
1502061203	2	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Nuoketi1.png	Easy-peasy.	0									
1502061204	2	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Nuoketi1.png	Tsk... But these assassins are so annoying.	0									
1502061205	2	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Nuoketi1.png	They just keep coming.	0									
1502061206	2	1	Fann	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V240fnNormal01.png	I can help you. Let's finish them off.	0									
1502061207	2	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Nuoketi1.png	What? I don't need you. Just take care of your dad.	0									
1502061208	2	1	Fann	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V240fnNormal01.png	I'll leave it to you then...	0									
1502061209	2	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Nuoketi1.png	Sure. Don't forget to call me if you are in trouble.	0									
1502061215	2	1	Commandant	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	I have confirmed their location and number with the drone's help.	0									
1502061216	2	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Nuoketi1.png	Oh? Not bad, Commandant.	0									
1502061217	2	1	Commandant	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Cough... The tactics, along with the routes, are ready.	0									
1502061218	2	1	Commandant	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	I have sent you everything, Noctis.	0									
1502061219	2	1	Commandant	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiUnknown02.png	Destroy them all. Don't let them hurt the residents.	0									
1502061225	2	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Nuoketi1.png	Hah? What is that?	0									
1502061226	2	1	Enemy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal04.png	Don't kill me... Please...	0									
1502061227	2	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Nuoketi1.png	Okay? But it depends on what you can offer me in exchange.	0									
1502061228	2	1	Enemy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal04.png	I will tell you everything I know!	0									
1502061229	2	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Nuoketi1.png	Then say it out! Stop wasting time!	0									
1502061230	2	1	Enemy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal04.png	More reinforcements... are on their way.	0									
1502061231	2	1	Enemy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal04.png	They will land on the empty space to the front left of the mayor's home.	0									
1502061232	2	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Nuoketi1.png	Max's house... You better be telling the truth. Do you know what I mean?	0									
1502061233	2	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Nuoketi1.png	If I ever find you lying, the bombs on you will explode right away. They won't kill you but will hurt you so much that you wish you were dead.	0									
1502061234	2	1	Enemy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal04.png	No... I'm telling the truth, I swear.	0

1502061601	2	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V200jxzbNormal01.png	Equip the medal?	0									
1502061101	3	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Nuoketi1.png	These bottles... Is it gas?	3									
1502061102	3	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Nuoketi1.png	There's oil on the packaging. It's for food. They must have been here for a while.	3									
1502061103	3	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Nuoketi1.png	The remaining gas and the detonator... Better watch out.	3									
1502061104	3	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Nuoketi1.png	This looks like some sort of sign... Is the message hidden over there?	3									
1502061105	3	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Nuoketi1.png	This feels like... braille! It's him!	3									
1502061106	3	1	Noctis	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR2Nuoketi1.png	The switch is here!	3									
301303131	2	1	Hero	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal01.png	... (Agitated, restless.)	2									
301303132	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya2.png	Why are there so many guards? Is he a hero or a criminal?	2									
301303133	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya2.png	Shall I investigate them? There are quite a few guards on the street, but I can still find some space.	2									
301303134	2	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	It wouldn't be a problem if we are in the real world... Speaking of which, since Gray Ravens have all been shrunk, will they get bonuses sneaking in?	2									
301303135	2	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	Still... It seems quite risky. What do you think, guys?	0									
301303136	2	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	Okay. I know we can count on you, Commandant.	2									
301303137	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya2.png	My character has not learned any skill related to [Stealth]. I think we have to leave the task to Commandant.	2									
301303138	2	1	Changyu	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/ChangyuNormal01.png	Alright, deal. I also have something to investigate.	2									
301303139	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLiQ.png	They caught us.	1									
301303140	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadluxiya3Q.png	Run to me, everyone.	1									
301303141	3	1	Hero	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal01.png	... (Anxiously looking around.)	0									
301303142	2	1	Sophia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya2.png	Let's come back here again after finishing our investigations.	2									
301303143	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadluxiya3Q.png	We should get going too.	2									
301303144	3	1	Hero	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal01.png	... (Keep the movement unnoticeable.)	0									
301303145	3	1	Hero	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V130nmNormal01.png	(Tch, did they find it out?)	0									
301303146	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLiQ.png	Two guards left. We must find a way to get around them.	2									
301303147	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLifuQ.png	But this is the only way taking us upstairs.	2									
301303148	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadluxiya3Q.png	I think I have a pretty good plan.	2									
301303149	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLiQ.png	Oh? Are we going to confront them directly?	2									
301303150	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadluxiya3Q.png	Of course not. I'll take care of the guards at the gate.	2									
301303151	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLifuQ.png	Be careful, Lucia.	2									
301303152	2	1	Guard	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NvDuiZhangNormal02.png	Who's there? Stop!	2									
301303153	3	1	Guard	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NvDuiZhangNormal02.png	You can't run around here, kid. This is a restricted area.	0									
301303154	3	1	Guard	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NvDuiZhangNormal02.png	Just go away if you have nothing better to do.	0									
301303160	3	1	Guard	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NvDuiZhangNormal02.png	Stop fooling around, otherwise I'll teach you a lesson.	0									
301303161	3	1	Guard	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NvDuiZhangNormal02.png	Hmm? What can I do for you, kid?	0									
301303162	3	1	Guard	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NvDuiZhangNormal02.png	Stupid brat. Quit fooling around here!	0									
301303163	3	1	Guard	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NvDuiZhangNormal02.png	Hmm? How can I help you, kid?	0									
301303164	3	1	Guard	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NvDuiZhangNormal02.png	Kids nowadays are just so full of energy.	0									
301303165	3	1	Guard	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NvDuiZhangNormal02.png	(Speaking of which, I don't think I have ever seen her.)	0									
301303166	3	1	Guard	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NvDuiZhangNormal02.png	(Wait a second, I don't think she's from nearby...)	0									
301303167	3	1	Guard	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NvDuiZhangNormal02.png	Huh? Did I just hear a sound?	0									
301303168	3	1	Guard	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/NvDuiZhangNormal02.png	Huh? What's that sound?	0									
301303169	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadluxiya3Q.png	The plan went well. I better leave now.	2									
301303170	2	1	Ayla (GM)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Congrats to Kamui for leveling up. The number of remaining monsters in the current area is... 5.	2									
301303171	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1SS.png	Hehe, easy-peasy.	2									
301303172	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Kuluomu1.png	Let's keep up the good work and finish off all the remaining enemies.	4									
301303173	2	1	Ayla (GM)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Alright, time to roll a die to determine the monsters' remaining combat capabilities.	2.5									
301303174	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1SS.png	I'll do it! I'm in luck today!	3									
301303175	2	1	Ayla (GM)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Nice, that was a great roll. Let me take a look...	2									
301303176	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1SS.png	Ta-da! Just as planned!	2									
301303177	2	1	Ayla (GM)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	This roll will determine the monsters' remaining combat capabilities. The larger the number, the tougher they are.	3									
301303178	2	1	Ayla (GM)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	...1!	2									
301303179	2	1	Ayla (GM)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	...2!	2

301303184	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1SS.png	No! I want a reroll...	2									
301303185	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1SS.png	Um... That must be an accident.	2									
301303186	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1SS.png	Not too bad... I guess?	2									
301303187	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1SS.png	Not bad.	2									
301303188	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1SS.png	See? Told you.	2									
301303189	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Kuluomu1.png	I guess that's quite lucky in a way.	3									
301303190	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Kuluomu1.png	Hmm... That's not very difficult. Let's finish them off quick.	3									
301303191	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Kuluomu1.png	At least it's not a 6...	3									
301303192	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Kuluomu1.png	Well... It's a rare experience, isn't it?	3									
301303193	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1SS.png		2									
301303194	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1SS.png	That's the last one! Don't let it get away!	2									
301303195	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Kuluomu1.png	Stop it, Kamui.	1									
301303196	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1SS.png	Leave it to me!	1									
301303197	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1SS.png	Haha, you can't run from me!	2									
301303198	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1SS.png	Your life is coming to an end! Stop running and turn into my EXP!	2									
301303199	2	1	Ayla (GM)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Aila1.png	Is that so? Let me do an evolution roll... Success!	2									
301303200	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1SS.png	What?! Seriously?	2									
301303201	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1SS.png	Wait, why did the evolution even change the species?	4									
301303202	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Kuluomu1.png	This is going to be bad... Kamui!	3									
301303203	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1SS.png	Alright, just leave it to me.	3									
301303204	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1SS.png	Oh no! We lost it!	2									
301303205	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1SS.png	Finally, it's all over. Let's go meet up with Commandant, Captain.	4									
301303206	2	1	Chrome	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Kuluomu1.png	Sure. Anyway, that opponent was pretty tough. What did you get?	3									
301303207	2	1	Kamui	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1SS.png	A lot, of course! I just went up many levels. Just wait and see me fight.	3									
301303208	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/Role/RoleHeadLifuQ.png	Try again, Commandant. I'm sure you can do it.	2
