1	Disruption	Triggers the disruption of the target's information field and temporarily reduces the shield of enemies with the Equilibrium Field.

2	Ignition	The frame's condensed nitrogen has been replaced with a newly created chemical material with an optimized ignition process, making it easier to set the target on fire and deal damage to it over time through attacks.

3	Ultima Slash	Adjusts the frame's operation process in battle for an instant output of computing power and launches an extremely powerful attack, dealing damage to the target.

4	Plasma Beam	Unleashes powerful energy in a short period to disturb the electrical field of the surroundings. Spreads electric particles to deal damage periodically to the target.

5	Glaciation	The cryogenic technology added after multiple iterations of battle modules allows frames to create a small low-temperature area during battle. Further attacks can be unlocked when the parameters in the area reach the preset values over time.

6	Darkflow	Using a new type of accelerator technology, it generates and collects dark particles under high pressure, releasing a radiation wave upon reaching critical mass that creates a nullification effect on surrounding targets.

7	Raydiance	"When plasma is focused by the crystal cluster, the micromitter matrix unleashes it if the electric arc is constrained, producing the ""Raydiance"" effect, which deals massive damage to targets in a short time."
