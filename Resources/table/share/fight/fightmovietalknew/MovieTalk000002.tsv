250106922	4	1	Child		What does the world outside look like?		4				
250106923	4	1	Construct		Test passed. Physical qualities are good. Move on to the next test.		4				
250106924	4	1	Child		Mister...?		4				
250106925	4	1	Construct		...Forget it. Go and get your lunch. The test can wait.		4				
250106926	4	1	Child		Someone tried to escape the other day, you know?		4				
250106927	4	1	■■■		I heard those Babylonian Constructs gathered a lot of people.		4				
250106928	4	1	■■■		So what? They still got caught in the end.		4				
250106929	4	1	■■■		Why escape? It's nice here...		4				
250106930	4	1	■■■		I just don't get them.		4				
250106931	4	1	■■■		Hm... This is not right. Let's check it again.		4				
250106932	4	1	■■■		According to Dr. Pickman's prediction, this data should be above 50% at least.		4				
250106933	4	1	Child		I was by the wall last night and heard a lady weeping...		4				
250106934	4	1	Adult		Perhaps you had a bad dream. How could there be anyone crying in a place like Utopia?		4				
250106935	4	1	Child		But...		4				
250106936	4	1	Alright, it's about time for dinner.		Be a good kid. Claim the supplies and go to bed early just like the Utopia Protocols say.		5				
250106937	4	1	Female Construct		How could it act up...?		4				
250106938	4	1	Construct		It's said that those Constructs tampered with it when they escaped.		4				
250106939	4	1	Female Construct		Sigh... Let's fix it ASAP. Or we'll have to copy the Utopia Protocols again.		4				
250106940	4	1	Construct		They used it to send messages... How did it work?		4				
250106941	4	1	Adult		Hey! No running around in the corridor according to the Utopia Protocols!		4				
250106942	4	1	Child		I don't care about what Utopia Protocols! I am leaving!		4				
250106943	4	1	Adult		What are you talking about? Where can you get food out there?		4				
250106944	4	1	Child		I don't care! There has to be a way!		4				
250106945	4	1	Base Guard		Ugh... I hate this job.		4				
250106946	4	1	Base Guard		Be vigorous and careful... The Utopia Protocols are just a pain in the neck...		4				
250106947	4	1	Base Guard		I'd better get someone else to do this job next time...		4				
250106948	4	1	Report Construct		This is how the Squad 2 is positioned.		4				
250106949	4	1	Female Construct		Did we get the firepower ready? We can't let any Constructs escape again.		4				
250106950	4	1	Report Construct		We have reinforced the security system. It won't happen again.		4				
250106951	4	1	Female Construct		How in the world did they even escape, though...		4				
250106952	4	1	Construct A		Someone tried to escape the other day, you know?		4

280103003	1	1			The Chaofeng Crew is in charge of the lantern exhibition this year, but you can also ask Hanying of the Pulao Crew for details.		0				
280103004	1	1			Hanying...? Sounds familiar.		0

280103008	4	1	Theater Owner		Ah... That Changyu has still not returned... Yu, can you help me find him?		5				
280103009	4	1	Pulao		Are the fireworks and lanterns ready?		5				
280103010	1	1			All set!		0				
280103011	1	1			Great! Let's set off the fireworks together later!		0

280103019	1	1	Qu		Okay... Thank you.		0				
280103020	3	1	Hanying		Kowloong is as busy as it ever was. It's big enough to be everybody's home.		8				
280103021	3	1	Hanying		This is the best Kowloong in the best era, Lady Qu.		6				
280103022	3	1	Qu		True... Are the fireworks ready?		6				
280103023	3	1	Hanying		Yoyo and Uno are working on it, but you don't have to check on them. It's kind of dangerous...		9				
280103024	3	1	Qu		A Kowloong festival should have the Kowloong spirit.		6.5				
280103025	3	1	Hanying		Of course.		3				
280103026	1	1			Would you like to take a walk around, Lady Qu?		0				
280103027	1	1	Changyu		Oh! I almost forgot that Director and Yu were waiting for the booze...		0

280103031	3	1	Tai'E		...? The amount you told me.		3				
280103032	3	1	Changyu		Director, you see, it's the Lantern Festival, how about tomorrow we...?		8.5				
280103033	3	1	Theater Owner		Heheh... You little... Don't go too far!		6				
280103034	3	1	Qu		You don't seem to care about who I am, do you?		3.5				
280103035	3	1	Hanying		That's because you're always on our side, Lady Qu.		7				
280103036	3	1	Qu		I really should let Moyuan teach you about fear and respect...		6				
280103037	3	1	Hanying		Isn't it good enough to live freely and happily like this?		9				
280103038	3	1	Qu (?)		Isn't this the Kowloong you've always wanted?		6				
280103039	1	1			Thirty-seven million five hundred and twenty thousand calculation loops have passed. Only you still think that we lost that war. They don't even remember your name.		0				
280103040	1	1			Stay with me. Let's make Kowloong prosper forever.		0				
280103041	3	1	Qu (?)		Do you really want to see this Kowloong getting overwhelmed by the fire of war and blood?		6				
280103042	3	1	Qu (?)		Do you really want to destroy this Kowloong yourself?		6				
280103043	3	1	Qu		No. That's not right...		4				
280103044	3	1	Qu		You're covering up the truth.		4				
280103045	3	1	Qu		Kowloong... No.		4

280103052	3	1	Qu (?)		Still refuse to wake up?		5				
280103053	3	1	Moyuan		Time to go home, ■■■.		3.5				
280103054	3	1	Yazi		We are counting on you, ■■■.		4				
280103055	3	1	Changyu		"What will we perform tomorrow, Director? ""Golden Millet Dream""? When can we get our stage into the Chamber of Commerce?"		9				
280103056	3	1	Director		Stop showing off! You aren't making enough for that!		7				
280103057	3	1	Pulao		Look, Uno! That is the skyscraper of the Chamber of Commerce. The Chiwen Crew works there.		8				
280103058	3	1	Tai'E		Hmm... I love the full moon...		6				
280103059	3	1	Pulao		I know, right? I've never been to the roof top of their building!		6				
280103060	3	1	Hanying		Where do we go tomorrow?		5				
280103061	3	1	Pulao		How about the theater?		4

280103069	3	1	Qu (?)		The endless battle is over.		6				
280103070	3	1	Qu (?)		Accept it. Your struggle is meaningless—		6				
280103071	3	1	Qu (?)		Still refuse to accept the truth?		5				
280103072	3	1	Qu		This Kowloong had already fallen in the war thirty-two years ago.		6				
280103073	3	1	Qu		...No. It's not like that.		4				
280103074	3	1	Qu		Although this is the Kowloong my people and I have always wanted...		6.5				
280103075	3	1	Qu		But the real Kowloong is not like this.		6				
280103076	3	1	Qu		Even if it is torn apart by war, full of pain, separation, grief, and death...		14				
280103077	3	1	Qu		Even if they are honest about their feelings and all the truths have been buried by the darkness...		10				
280103078	3	1	Qu		I choose to shoulder my responsibility and accept the real Kowloong, but not today, not now.		11				
280103079	3	1	Qu		Not ever.		2.5				
280103080	3	1	Qu (?)		This is your last chance. The moon will go down soon, and the stars are going to get dark.		12				
280103081	3	1	Qu		But the sun will rise again.		3.5

102041	3	1	Data Turbulence		If you order so, then I shall never lose.		10				
102051	3	1	Data Turbulence		I'm glad you are our Commandant.		10				
102169	3	1	Data Turbulence		Lucia, ready to fight!		7				
1022002	3	1	Data Turbulence		Getting used to the original memories isn't easy, but I'll try.		10				
1022012	3	1	Data Turbulence		Gray Raven... I never thought I'd get to know a squad three times... Such a peculiar feeling.		10				
1022042	3	1	Data Turbulence		I've been waiting for you, Commandant.		8				
1022043	3	1	Data Turbulence		I've been waiting, Commandant. Let's go.		9

110303101	1	1	<color=#3399ff>Lucia</color>	500994	The communication's been cut off, but according to these coordinates, Liv is definitely somewhere in this area.		0				
110303102	1	1	<color=#3399ff>Lucia</color>	500994	But the information density in this area is too high. It'll be difficult to pinpoint exactly where the signal disappeared in such a short time.		0				
110303103	1	1	<color=#3399ff>Ishmael</color>	501095	Leave it to me. This area was reconstructed from terrain data I collected myself. If you send me the frequency samples, I can trace them back to the transmission point.		0				{1: '1', 3: '1'}

110303105	1	1	<color=#3399ff>Ishmael</color>	501095	Got it. By the way, I'm detecting hostile signals approaching from ahead. Take precautions.		0				{1: '1', 3: '1'}
110307901	1	1	<color=#3399ff>Lee</color>	500568	Commandant, it appears Lucia was taken by enemies, moved rapidly for some time, and has now entered an area that's beyond our detection capabilities.		0				
110307902	1	1	<color=#3399ff>Lee</color>	500568	And judging from the violent fluctuations in the signal before it disappeared, she must have been engaged in intense combat...		0				
110307903	1	1	<color=#3399ff>Liv</color>	500400	We need to hurry and help Lucia. If only there was some way to break through this invisible barrier...		0				{1: '1', 3: '1'}
110307904	1	1	<color=#3399ff>Ishmael</color>	501095	I can break through this invisible barrier by restructuring the area's data.		0				
110307905	1	1	<color=#3399ff>Ishmael</color>	501095	However, I can only create a small opening at the edge of the map. This will drop you into an area you're not supposed to access.		0				
110307906	1	1	<color=#3399ff>Ishmael</color>	501095	And to ensure your safe return, I'll need to stay here and keep this opening from closing.		0				
110307907	1	1	<color=#3399ff>Liv</color>	500400	I understand. We'll be extra careful once we're inside. Thank you, Ishmael.		0				{1: '1', 3: '1'}
110307908	1	1	<color=#3399ff>Ishmael</color>	501095	Save the formalities for when everyone's reunited. Now, I'm going to open the breach.		0
