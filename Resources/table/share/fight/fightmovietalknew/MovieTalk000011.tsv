1030011801	3	1	Luna		You filthy insects!		3				
1030011802	3	1	α		Time to go home		3				
969922161	3	1	Luna		Has the Punishing Virus... calmed down somehow?		3				
969922162	3	1	Luna		Must I destroy all the nodes ahead to get out of this passage?		3				
1030011803	3	1	Stage Designer		Sorry, the performance here is not ready yet. It will have the same format as the previous one though.		3				
1030011804	3	1	Luna		"The power of the Red Tide has infiltrated this place... Someone has already made a ""deal."""		3

1030010604	2	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LunaNormal02.png	Data... cannot flow normally here.		3				
1030010605	2	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LunaNormal02.png	Is the key hidden over there...?		3				
1030010606	2	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LunaNormal02.png	The key to breaking the shackles lies within.		3				
1030010607	2	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LunaNormal02.png	But this energy...		3				
1030010608	2	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LunaNormal02.png	While I can break in directly...		2.3				
1030010609	2	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LunaNormal02.png	Based on the energy flow, if I disable the nodes one by one,		5				
1030010610	2	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LunaNormal02.png	The risk will be much lower...		3				
1030010611	2	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LunaNormal02.png	One last try.		3				
1030010612	2	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LunaNormal02.png	Should have done it earlier.		3

1030010615	2	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LunaNormal02.png	This passage... leads directly to the last node.		3				
1030010616	2	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LunaNormal02.png	...A shortcut created by the data collisions?		3				
1030010617	2	1	Luna	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/LunaNormal02.png	Stay focused.		3

74730101	3	1	Wanshi		Understood, let's go.		4.5				
74730102	3	1	Greg & Sandy		Copy that.		1.5				
74730103	3	1	Greg		Toys, books, everything's a mess... and Babylonia Construct remains... What happened here?		9.5				
74730104	3	1	Wanshi		Stay alert. There's still quite a bit of Punishing Virus left here.		3.5				
74730105	3	1	Sandy		The Ascendant used this place as their base, after all...		3.5				
74730106	3	1	Wanshi		No... It's not just the Ascendant.		3.5				
74730107	3	1	Wanshi		There are still some Corrupted remaining... Have to make it quick.		3.5				
74730108	2	1	Sandy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotinvNormal01.png	A high concentration of the Punishing Virus is detected over there as well. I'll go check it out with Greg.		3.5				
74730109	3	1	Wanshi		All the information here can be captured by Hawkeye.		3.5				
74730110	3	1	Researcher A		Run!		5.5				
74730111	3	1	Researcher B		How is it possible for the Punishing Virus to be inside here?!		5.5				
74730112	3	1	Researcher A		They say that lab got wrecked! All the Punishing Virus has leaked out!		6.5				
74730113	3	1	Wanshi		These traces are old... left from clashes between humans and the Corrupted.		4.5				
74730114	3	1	Wanshi		Is this why the institute was wiped out?		2.5				
74730115	3	1	Wanshi		...All the specimen tanks were shattered. Biological experiments, maybe?		5.5				
74730116	2	1	Sandy	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotinvNormal01.png	Oh!		3.5				
74730117	2	1	Greg	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/TongyonggouzaotiNomal04.png	Sandy?! Ugh-ahh!		3.5				
74730118	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Wanshi1.png	Hello? Greg? Sandy?		3.5				
74730119	3	1	Wanshi		Commandant, something happened on their end. I can't reach them.		3.5				
74730120	3	1	Wanshi		Hold on... There's more information here.		3.5				
74730121	3	1	Wanshi		Let me try to analyze it with Hawkeye.		1.5				
74730122	3	1	Wanshi		Are these... test subjects?		3.5				
74730123	3	1	Wanshi		They were actually... using children as specimens.		4.5				
74730124	3	1	Wanshi		...Something's off, Commandant. Greg and Sandy may have found something.		6.5				
74730125	3	1	Wanshi		Don't go there yet. Come to me first. We've got a situation here.		4.5				
74730126	3	1	Wanshi		It's not over yet.		2.5				
74730127	3	1	Wanshi		Now's not the time to sleep.		4.5				
74730128	3	1	Wanshi		Looks like some children's doodles.		3.5				
74730129	3	1	Wanshi		An oil pastel? There's a... metal spike hidden inside?		8.5				
74730130	3	1	Wanshi		Children's toys...		2.5				
74730131	3	1	Wanshi		The kids here... Were they all turned into Constructs?		5.5				
74730132	1	1			Would you like to familiarize the moves of the new frame?		0				{4: '0', 5: '0', 6: '0'}
74730133	3	1			Let's take a look with Hawkeye.		2.5				
74730134	3	1			Looks like it won't open...		2.5				
74730135	3	1	Rosetta		Perhaps you've noticed that the Punishing Virus concentration is higher in the hall than above. Let's move through quickly.		6.5				
74730136	3	1	Wanshi		There are also Hetero-Creatures here? I've never seen that form before.		6.5				
74730137	3	1	Wanshi		Watch out, they are all hiding in the shadows!		3.5				
74730138	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Wanshi1.png	Ugh... My M.I.N.D... isn't fully stabilized yet.		4.5				
74730139	3	1	Wanshi		Uh... I feel much better now. Don't worry.		2.5				
74730140	3	1	Wanshi		Commandant, hold off on going there for now. It's not safe inside.		4.5				
74730141	3	1	Rosetta		That wasn't so bad. Let's keep looking for more leads.		4.5				
74730142	3	1	Wanshi		Stay alert. There's something suspicious about that door at the end of the hall.		4.5				
74730143	3	1	Wanshi		We should go check it out first. I can see a large space behind that door.		4.5				
74730144	3	1	Rosetta		Sure, let's go.		3.5				
74730145	3	1	Wanshi		No, can't open it. It requires an access card.		4.5				
74730146	3	1	Rosetta		Just blast it open, then.		2.5				
74730147	3	1	Wanshi		Are you here for a speedrun or to look for clues?		4.5				
74730148	3	1	Rosetta		...Let's go find an access card.		2.5				
74730149	3	1	Wanshi		There might still be Hetero-Creatures around there. Let's search this area first.		3.5				
74730150	3	1	Wanshi		I'll go look around the back.		1.5				
74730151	3	1	Wanshi		Then let's split up. I'll check the other side.		2.5				
74730152	3	1	Wanshi		And Commandant?		1.5				
74730153	3	1	Wanshi		I'll check out the fork behind the door. Stay in touch.		3.5				
74730154	3	1	Wanshi		That toy... I should go take a look.		3.5				
74730155	3	1	Wanshi		I'm detecting quite a lot of information from the toy... I'll try using Hawkeye.		4.5				
74730156	5	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	Nothing unusual over here. What about you?		2.5				
74730157	3	1	Wanshi		I've got the access card and some details about the experiments on children.		4.5				
74730158	5	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	Experiments on children... Copy that. Let's regroup at the door and try opening it.		8.5				
74730159	3	1	Wanshi		Aight.		1.5				
74730160	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Wanshi1.png	Huff—this is neverending...		4.5				
74730161	2	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	Don't linger here! Hand me the access card. Let's get through the door!		3.5				
74730162	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Wanshi1.png	Leave the enemies to me. Quick!		2.5				
74730163	2	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	The door's open! But something seems to be blocking it from behind...		5.5				
74730164	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Wanshi1.png	Now, just give it a push!		2.5				
74730165	2	1	Rosetta	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/LuosaitaNormal05.png	Roger. Commandant, come inside!		4.5				
74730166	2	1	Wanshi	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR3Wanshi1.png	Let's go!		1.5				
74730167	2	1		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Tap Basic Attack repeatedly.		5				
74730168	2	1		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Ping Orbs or hold the Red Orb to build up the skill gauge. Once it's full, hold the Red Orb to enter Calibration Mode.		5				
74730169	2	1		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	In Calibration Mode, repeatedly tap the Red Orb or hold Basic Attack to fire bullets!		5				
74730170	2	1		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	After emptying the Cylinder, tap the Red Orb to throw your empty gun.		5				
74730171	2	1		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Tap the Red Orb or move to where the gun landed to retrieve it and refill the Cylinder.		5				
74730172	2	1		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Use your Signature Move!		5				
74730173	2	1		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/KuruoruoNormal01.png	Seems it hasn't been activated yet...		5				
74730174	4	1			A lusterless teddy bear... next to a small, mangled body.		0				
74730175	4	1			Childhood innocence and dreams, abandoned and scattered.		0

74730177	4	1			These branches, sprouting out of nowhere, appear to be entirely formed from Punishing.		0				
74730178	3	1	Wanshi		Let's head back and check that door again.		3.5				
74730179	1	1	Huaxu	500160	Yup, but... Surge, engage!		0				
74730180	2	1	Commandant	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/zhgNormal01.png	Let's meet up at their location. I'm afraid this mission is way more challenging than expected.		0

103201021	3		Luna		These traces are fresh...		3				
150211051	3				This must be the legendary Project Winter... how intriguing.		6

150211053	3		Lilith		Too bad, today's not your day to meet your maker. After all, that gentleman has high hopes for you.		8				
150211080	5	1	Madam Monzano (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3100auntNormal01.png	That ship was never going to keep everyone alive.		3				
150211081	5	1	Madam Monzano (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3100auntNormal01.png	Only my colony ship can usher in a new golden age!		3				
150211082	3	1	Lilith		Living in the past... ha, a tempting notion.		3				
150211083	3	1	Lilith		But what's the difference between that and being a fossil?		4				
150211084	5	1	Vonnegut	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/FengneigutemianjuNormal02.png	The new you is the culmination of every choice you've made. Don't let hesitation stifle your ambition, Lilith.		7				
150211085	5	1	Madam Monzano (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3100auntNormal02.png	Heh. Did I forget to mention? Discord was always an expendable pawn... and the deal's done.		5				
150211086	5	1	Madam Monzano (?)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3100auntNormal02.png	And the deal is already done.		3				
150211087	3	1	Lilith		There are many things you could call pawns... but my beloved dolls are off-limits!		5				
150211054	5	1	Madam Monzano	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3100auntNormal01.png	Approaching the airspace of the North Asian Research Institute of Life Science and Evolution.		4

150211056	5	1	Madam Monzano	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3100auntNormal01.png	Eleanor, confirm our objectives.		3				
150211057	3	1	Lilith		"Assassinate Godwin, and gather as much intel as possible on ""Project Winter""."		4				
150211058	3	1	Lilith		Outer perimeter patrols neutralized, resistance encountered as anticipated.		5

150211060	5	1	Godwin	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleStory/V3100gdwNormal01.png	Looks like a little pest has crawled in here. I'm warning you, the decontamination systems aren't forgiving.		10				
150211061	3	1	Lilith		"Huh? You call those rust buckets that can barely lift an arm ""decontamination systems""?"		5				
301304521	3	1	Lucia		The cries for help are coming from up ahead. Let's go, Commandant.		5				
301304522	3	1	Lucia		The family turf war is raging up ahead. If we want to reach the factory, we'll have to push through it.		6				
301304523	3	1	Lucia		The fighting is only getting worse... Looks like this is the main front.		5				
301304524	3	1	Lucia		I can hear hostages calling for help in the distance. Commandant, let's keep moving.		6				
301304525	3	1	Lucia		Breaking through!		3				
301304526	3	1	Lucia		Commandant, the combat zone is tight and the fire is heavy. Please be careful.		6				
301304527	3	1	Lucia		All hostages inside are safe. Time to fall back, Commandant.		6				
301304561	3	1	Lucia		Combat initiated. Awaiting your orders, Commandant.		5				
301304562	3	1	Lucia		The hall's secure for now. Are you alright, Commandant?		5				
301304563	2	1	Russell	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadV3200YF01.png	Heh heh heh... The Savoys sure are powerful.		6

301304566	2	1	Olivia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAlwyNormal01.png	We're running out of time! We have to end this battle quickly!		7				
301304567	2	1	Olivia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAlwyNormal01.png	The wedding must be completed before the stroke of twelve!		5				
301304568	2	1	Olivia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAlwyNormal01.png	If this tradition is violated...		5				
301304569	3	1	Lucia		The enemy has deployed heavy weapons and launched an attack... Commandant, please retreat for now. I'll hold them off out here!		7				
301304570	3	1	Lucia		...Got it. Let's stand together and put up a good fight, then!		5				
301304571	3	1	Lucia		The final wave is closing in! Commandant, stay close to me and ready yourself for one last fight!		5				
301304572	2	1	Olivia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAlwyNormal01.png	This is an iron law of Catania, unchanged for a thousand years!		5				
301304573	2	1	Olivia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAlwyNormal01.png	The Savoys would lose all the respect people have for them.		5				
301304574	2	1	Olivia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAlwyNormal01.png	And dissolving the Thirteen Families would become unthinkable!		5				
301304575	2	1	Russell	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadV3200YF01.png	It's all coming to an end today!		4

1502141714	3	1	Vera		Is this device still operational? What's it used for?		3.5				
1502141715	3	1	Vera		"Wait, it seems to be channeling energy into the ""Hollow."" Stand back, let me destroy it."		6				
1502141716	3	1	Vera		Hmph... Just as I thought, something's wrong.		3				
1502141717	3	1	Vera		There's still time...! I'm not done yet!		5

1502141722	3	1	Vera		How disgusting! Get lost!		5				
1502141723	3	1	Vera		It can't be destroyed... Something's protecting it. Seems like it's something important.		5
