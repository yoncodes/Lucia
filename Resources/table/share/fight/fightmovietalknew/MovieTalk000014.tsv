15400	2	1			And make a hat for Agrippa with any extra fabric.		3				
15401	1	1			Yuka receives the red fabric and indicates there is more than enough. Yata suggests she could make a hat for Agrippa with the extra material later.		0

15428	1	1			Oh yeah... I guess you've always seen me as a weakling who's always sick, no?		0				
15429	1	1			And weaklings can't run to save their lives... which is why the last dream crashed.		0				
15430	1	1	Yata		Yuka, I had a dream.		0

15442	1	1	Nakamura	501054	...All right, stop pressuring Yuka. Both of you need to focus on practicing!		0				{1: '1'}
15443	1	1	Yata	501042	Strange... When did these people in black appear?		0				
15444	1	1	Yuka	501051	Perhaps it's due to the recent nighttime security incident. The school must have increased security.		0				{1: '1'}

15446	1	1	Yata	501042	Yuka, I'll lure them away. Use that chance to get out of here.		0

15448	1	1			A piercing electronic hum fills the air, and a wave of nausea suddenly strikes Yuka's mind.		0				
15449	1	1			Fighting back the urge to vomit, she opens her eyes, only to see flashes of the quantum-simulated M.I.N.D. dance before her.		0				
15450	1	1	Nakamura		Yata... save Yuuko and Sekiguchi... I... tried my best...		0				{1: '1'}

15455	1	1			The power spring gleams with its silver lacquer finish, its patterns personally designed by Yuka... But will this music box, a symbol of friendship, ever play again with it...		0				
15456	1	1	Yata	501042	Yuka, everything is so perfect here...		0				
15457	1	1	Yata	501042	Too perfect to be true...		0

15473	3	1	Yuka		Come on, let's go.		4				
15474	3	1	Yuka		Here we are. There is just one final thing we need to do for the music box now.		4

9200375	3	1	Veronica		Why are you trailing me?		4				
9200376	3	1	Veronica		I get it if you need to catch your breath.		4				
9200377	1	1			Perhaps because she's just begun seeing the world from a new perspective, Veronica walks slowly and carefully. She's curious about everything around her, but her patrol duty keeps her from stopping to look.		0				{5: '1', 6: '1'}
9200378	3	1	Commandant		Such good weather. It would be a shame to waste it.		4				
9200379	3	1	Commandant		Humans get tired. We're not like machines.		4				
9200380	1	1	Commandant		I don't know much about mechanical life, but solar power should be the most convenient energy source for you. A little sunlight works as a recharge too.		0				{5: '1', 6: '1'}

9200383	1	1	Commandant		Humans get tired. We're not like machines.		0				
9200384	3	1	Commandant		Think of it as the sun giving you a free meal today.		4				
9200385	3	1	Commandant		Here, the little ones won't bother you.		4				
9200386	3	1	Commandant		Relax. The way you're sitting looks like you just crashed.		4				
9200387	3	1	Veronica		You know I could switch off your life support in a second, right?		4				
9200388	3	1	Veronica		Do you ever stop talking?		4				
9200389	3	1	Commandant		Maybe your silence makes it easier for others to speak.		4				
9200390	3	1	Commandant		Maybe it's because you don't talk much that I seem chatty. In a way, we balance each other out.		4				
9200391	3	1	Veronica		Is this... what it feels like to connect with someone?		4				
9200392	3	1	Commandant		Without question.		4				
9200393	3	1	Commandant		What do you think?		4				
9200394	1	1			The mechanical life form frowns and looks away.		0				
9200395	1	1	Commandant		(Hey, what did I do to make you upset?)		0				
9200396	1	1			The mechanical life form frowns and looks away.		0				
9200397	1	1	Commandant		(...Ugh, what is it this time?)		0				
9200398	3	1	Veronica		The color of this grass...		4				
9200399	3	1	Commandant		What's wrong?		3				
9200400	3	1	Veronica		Weird. It's not like it was before.		4				
9200401	1	1			Everything looks normal.		0				
9200402	1	1	Commandant		Rainfall and sunlight vary between regions, so changes in grass color are normal... Wait...		0				
9200403	1	1			Normally, plants reflect the environment around them. But is this grassland really normal? Could the color changes Veronica mentioned be a sign of something else?		0				
9200404	1	1			The wanderer's warning still echoes vividly. Strange animal migrations, shifting grass, and piercing insect cries—they all sound like ominous omens at this moment.		0				
9200405	1	1			Insects?		0				
9200406	1	1	Commandant		Come to think of it... Veronica, when we first met, were the insects here this loud?		0				
9200407	1	1	Veronica	501212	My memory modules show that the insect sounds have been getting louder and louder these past few days.		0				{1: '1', 3: '1'}
9200408	1	1			Could it be an infestation?		0				
9200409	1	1	Commandant		A healthy ecosystem keeps pests in check... something's definitely wrong here.		0				
9200410	1	1	Veronica	501212	Something's definitely off. The grass even changed color again just since we started chatting.		0				{1: '1', 3: '1'}
9200411	1	1			The changes Veronica mentioned can't be seen by the human eye or basic tools.		0				
9200412	1	1	Commandant		Veronica, please record the grass color data.		0				
9200413	1	1			Like a clumsy painter's strokes, the green stalks are stained with brown decay. But instead of fading, the color grows sharper, shifting from green to dark red, spreading like an invasion.		0				
9200414	1	1			Veronica has no doubt that soon, this grassland—still green to the eye—will be swallowed by vivid crimson.		0				
9200415	1	1	Veronica	501212	I don't know what your standard gear can pick up, but my eyes are telling me these grass patches are flickering between red and green. That's definitely not how they're supposed to grow.		0				{1: '1', 3: '1'}
9200416	1	1	Veronica	501212	Yeah, what about it?		0				{1: '1', 3: '1'}
9200417	1	1	Commandant		Everything in the world is connected... Veronica, this is nature's warning—its cry for help.		0

9200420	1	1	Commandant		For now, I'm your responsibility, and you're mine. Veronica, communication goes both ways.		0				
9200421	1	1	Veronica	501212	Fine. I'll head back right away.		0				{1: '1', 3: '1'}
9200422	1	1	Veronica	501212	It's dangerous out here. You... be careful.		0				{1: '1', 3: '1'}
9200423	1	1	Commandant		From what we've seen so far, this could be a Red Tide... We need to scout further to confirm.		0				
9200424	1	1	Veronica	501212	In that case, stay here. I'll scout ahead.		0				{1: '1', 3: '1'}
9200425	1	1	Commandant		You're going alone? That's too dangerous. Do you always fight solo like this?		0				
9200426	1	1	Veronica	501212	I've always worked alone. I don't need help or company.		0				{1: '1', 3: '1'}
9200427	3	1	Veronica		Besides, for a simple recon mission, you'd just be underfoot. We need to get to the bottom of this fast, don't we?		6				
9200428	3	1	Commandant		But... seeing how much you care about this really makes me happy.		4				
9200429	3	1	Veronica		I'm surprised you'd care so much.		5				
9200430	3	1	Veronica		Since I've given them names, these lions are my responsibility.		5				
9200431	3	1	Veronica		Alright... that includes you too.		5				
9200432	3	1	Veronica		Just for now, though.		5				
9200433	3	1	Commandant		It's an honor to be your responsibility.		5				
9200434	3	1	Commandant		I'm really happy.		5				
9200435	3	1	Veronica		We should get going.		5				
9200436	3	1	Commandant		Go on. Keep your comms open.		4				
9200437	3	1	Commandant		Veronica, everything alright?		4				
9200438	3	1	Veronica		I—		2				
9200439	3	1	Commandant		Veronica, you're back on the channel? Why did you cut comms?		4				
9200440	3	1	Veronica		So irritating... Why all the fuss about the comms? I'll be bringing the intel back myself soon enough anyway.		6				
9200441	3	1	Commandant		For now, I'm your responsibility, and you're mine. Veronica, communication goes both ways.		4				
9200442	3	1	Veronica		Fine. I'll head back right away.		4				
9200443	3	1	Veronica		It's dangerous out here. You... be careful.		5				
9200444	3	1	Commandant		You're not the only one who needs some peace and quiet. Sometimes I need to get away from those wild little ones too.		5				
9200445	3	1	Veronica		Calm down. I'm not some cub who can't handle herself. No need to make such a big deal out of it.		7				
9200446	2	1	Commandant	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/zhgNormal01.png	Veronica?		4				
9200447	2	1	Commandant	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/zhgNormal01.png	Is everything okay?		4				
9200448	2	1	Commandant	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/zhgNormal01.png	How are you holding up? Need backup?		4				{1: '1', 3: '1'}
9200449	1	1	Veronica	501212	I get it if you need to catch your breath.		0				
9200450	1	1			Veronica stands off to the side, looking stiff.		0				
9200451	1	1	Commandant		Relax. The way you're sitting looks like you just crashed.		0				
9200452	1	1	Veronica	501212	You know I could switch off your life support in a second, right?		0				{1: '1', 3: '1'}

9200454	1	1			The shadow of the dragon's wings sweeps across the grassland and stops over the strange ground. Crimson streams, like a spreading web, are slowly encircling the plain.		0
