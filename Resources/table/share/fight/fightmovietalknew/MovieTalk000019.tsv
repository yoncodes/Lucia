199910104	3	1	Vera		What the hell is this?		3				
199910105	3	1	Vera		No survivors from the Engineering Department, nor any bodies, but I can't shake the feeling that something else is here.		4				
199910106	3	1	Vera		The art exhibition area? I remember it should be on the left.		4				
199910107	3	1	Vera		OK, that should do it.		4				
199910108	3	1	Commandant		Vera, get out of there now! The dome is becoming unstable.		4				
199910109	3	1	Vera		Copy that. Heading to the evacuation area.		4

199910502	3	1	Vera		Ha, what a warm welcome.		3				
199910503	3	1	Vera		Tch, it's locked. Captain, do we have any breaching devices left?		5				
199910504	3	1	Captain		No more! Maybe we can find <color=#FF0000>access cards</color> on the building staff, but that area is full of those monsters!		6				
199910505	3	1	Captain		We've already lost some people, and communications are down... We might not even make it out of here ourselves.		4				
199910506	3	1	Vera		Check for casualties first. It's not over yet.		4				
199910507	3	1	Captain		Tsk, easy for you to say... Keep your eyes on that health signal detector and look for more survivors.		6				
199910508	3	1	Vera		"Impressive. You've completely reversed the labels for ""fatal"" and ""non-fatal"" wounds. Did they teach you to make such elementary errors at the academy?"		7				
199910509	3	1	Vera		Forget it, I'll handle the search mission. You stay here and catch your breath—just try not to die of fright if you see an enemy.		8				
199910510	3	1	Captain		Still with that damn attitude... You better not come back empty-handed!		3				
199910511	3	1	Vera		Hm? Here's an access card... Heading back to the gate now.		5				
199910512	3	1	Vera		Huh? Am I hallucinating...? Something's been off from the very beginning...		5

199910555	3	1	Host		Good evening, everyone, and welcome to the never-ending Mechanical Arena! Get ready for a jaw-dropping, sparks-flying, steel-on-steel spectacle!		10				
199910556	3	1	Spectator A		Yeah! Kill it—tear it apart—!		3				
199910557	3	1	Spectator B		We want blood! More blood!		3				
199910558	3	1	Host		"In tonight's main event, Veronica goes head-to-head with the mighty ""Crusher Pincers""! What tricks does she have up her sleeve, folks? Let's find out!"		10				
199910559	3	1	Veronica		Not even worth bothering with.		2				
199910560	3	1	Veronica		Nothing but brute force. What a waste of time.		3				
199910561	3	1	Veronica		Give up! It's no use!		2				
199910562	3	1	Host		"What an unbelievable turn of events! ""Crusher Pincers"" just launched a counterattack on Veronica! This battle is getting more and more intense!"		7				
199910563	3	1	Host		Let's see which side lands that heart-stopping finishing blow!		6				
199910564	3	1	Spectator A		Hahaha! What a thrill! Absolutely exhilarating!		5				
199910565	3	1	Spectator B		Finish it! Run that pathetic loser through—skewer it!		5				
199910566	3	1	System		Multiple frame damages detected. Maintenance request automatically submitted.		4				
199910567	3	1	Veronica		Hum...		1				
199910568	3	1	Staff Member A		Can you hurry it up? The monitoring system is scheduled for maintenance tonight. Let's get this done before then! I'm trying to clock out on time.		7				
199910569	3	1	Serra		Ah, sorry! Just a few more mechanoid modules to upgrade. I just need to make some adjustments at the terminal.		6				
199910570	3	1	Staff Member A		Fine, fine, I've given you full access. I'm out of here—just make it quick!		5				
199910571	3	1	Serra		"Phew, finally alone. Let me see... the ""Match Schedule"" system access should be... Got it!"		9				
199910572	3	1	Serra		"Status switching... input confirmed, done! Now all of Veronica's systems have been set to ""Awaiting Maintenance."""		7				
199910573	3	1	Serra		"Veronica, I've got everything squared away for our ""special plan."""		6				
199910574	3	1	Serra		"Don't sweat it, everything's going to be fine. Besides... we've got some ""friends"" helping us out."		6				
199910575	3	1	Serra		"Alright, let's cut off communications here. I'm getting a little antsy about all these ""sensitive terms""—don't want to tip anyone off..."		6				
199910576	3	1	Veronica		Got it.		2				
199910577	3	1	Veronica		"Do you truly believe who you are now is your ""real"" self?"		7				
199910578	3	1	Serra		Alright, system maintenance is almost wrapped up... now's our window!		7				
199910579	3	1	Staff Member A		Ugh, another system maintenance? Seriously, it kept me working overtime this late! At least I can finally clock out.		8				
199910580	3	1	Staff Member A		Who's there?!		2				
199910581	3	1	Serra		C-crap, why is someone still here?		5				
199910582	3	1	Serra		Shoot, nowhere to hide... I gotta jump...		8				
199910583	3	1	Veronica		Are you trying to get yourself killed?!		3				
199910584	3	1	Serra		L-let me go. You scared the living daylights out of me! Thank goodness it's just you.		5				
199910585	3	1	Serra		Quick, put me down! Someone's coming!		3				
199910586	3	1	Staff Member A		I must be seeing things... Definitely working too much overtime.		5				
199910587	3	1	Serra		Perfect! Now's our chance! The surveillance system is going into maintenance mode. No one will spot us now.		6				
199910588	3	1	Veronica		Stick close to me.		1.5				
199910589	3	1	Serra		Something's not right... Why have my access permissions been revoked?		6				
199910590	3	1	Staff Member B		Don't even bother! What, did you really think your little tricks would fly here? Target acquired! Get them!		7				
199910591	3	1	Guard Mechanoid		Command confirmed. Target locked. Initiating combat protocol.		5				
199910592	3	1	Veronica		Fools who don't know their place. Anyone in my path will be eliminated.		7				
199910593	3	1	Veronica		You bastards... You're not... getting away...		8				
199910594	3	1	Staff Member B		Well, would you look at that. This mechanoid actually put up more of a fight than I figured.		6				
199910595	3	1	Serra		Veronica... Let me go! VERONICA!		7				
199910596	4	1	Security Guard A		Well, well, if it isn't our new rising star?		4				
199910597	4	1	Security Guard B		Hey! Light repair gear is in the general section.		4				
199910598	4	1	Security Guard B		This isn't where you should be.		4				
199910599	4	1	Security Guard C		Nothing to see here. Move along.		4				
199910600	3	1	Unremarkable Repairer		Are you the new gladiator? The way you fought just now was really impressive.		5				
199910601	3	1	Unremarkable Repairer		"But strength means nothing here. We're all just ""tools"" for human amusement."		5				
199910602	3	1	Unremarkable Repairer		Forget it, I'm rambling. The auto-repair unit's right across from here. Go patch up your frame.		5				
199910603	3	1	Unremarkable Repairer		Good luck.		4				
199910604	3	1	Unremarkable Repairer		Oh, right, I didn't tell you my name. I'm Hawked-V, a new fighter here just like you.		5				
199910605	3	1	Hawked-V		If you don't mind, would you spar with me before the match? Honestly, gladiator fights have always scared me.		5				
199910606	3	1	Hawked-V		Alright, I'll do my best.		4				
199910607	3	1	Hawked-V		I knew I wasn't wrong about you. You're really strong. If we end up fighting in the arena, it'll be a great match—even if I lose.		6				
199910608	3	1	Hawked-V		Anyway, thanks. You've lit my fighting spirit again. I'll keep pushing myself from now on.		5				
199910609	3	1	Hawked-V		That's a shame, but I guess it's just because I'm too weak.		5				
199910610	4	1	Staff Member A		Who are you betting on next round?		3				
199910611	4	1	Staff Member B		I'm putting 300,000 on Veronica to win!		3				
199910612	4	1	Staff Member A		Nice! You've got guts!		3				
199910613	4	1	Noisy Mechanoid		Lights on, game on.		3				
199910614	4	1	Noisy Mechanoid		It's past three. Time to top up my oil.		3				
199910615	4	1	Noisy Mechanoid		You don't actually think outside is better, do you? It's obviously nicer here.		3
