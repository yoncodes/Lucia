1501030801	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Commandant, I've noticed some differences in the mirrors on these doors.		6				
1501030802	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	Well done, Commandant. This seems to be the right way!		4				
1501030803	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR6Luxiya1.png	Commandant, here are five doors.		5				
1501030804	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR6Luxiya1.png	The path upward must be behind one of these doors.		4				
1501030805	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR6Luxiya1.png	Hetero-Creatures eliminated		6				
1501030806	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR6Luxiya1.png	Looks like Hetero-Creatures will spawn if we open the wrong door.		6				
1501030807	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	This doesn't seem to be the right door.		7				
1501030808	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	Commandant, try inspecting the mirror on the door again.		7				
1501030809	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR6Luxiya1.png	Commandant, the layout here appears similar to that of the previous floor.		7				
1501030810	2	1	Alpha	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/V210aefNormal01.png	Hah, piece of cake!		5				
1501030811	2	1	Lee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Li1.png	The correct path might have something to do with the mirror.		7				
1501030812	2	1	Liv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png	The right path lies behind the only door left...		5				
1501030813	2	1	Lucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR6Luxiya1.png	The same rules may apply. Search for the correct path again.		7

96992500	3	1	Child		After she gave me this bag of candy, she disappeared with the staff...		4				
96992501	3	1	Child		Go away! I won't touch you again.		4				
96992502	3	1	Child		We're not allowed to leave because it's dangerous outside.		4				
96992503	3	1	Child		When will the training end?		3				
96992504	3	1	???		"Do you want ""freedom""?"		3				
96992505	3	1	Polard Instructor		(Whistle) I want everybody to line up now!		2				
96992506	3	1	Polard Instructor		Here, you speak only when ordered!		3				
96992507	3	1	Polard Instructor		The only thing you can do is obey!		4				
96992508	3	1	Polard Instructor		Anyone who attempts to escape will face severe punishment!		4				
96992509	1	1	Polard Instructor		Words. Emotions. Thoughts. Your will is your weakness.\nHere, you only need your instinct and absolute obedience!		0				
96992510	1	1	Polard Instructor		Here, you only need your instinct and absolute obedience!		6				
96992511	3	1	???		Follow orders... Go assemble.		3				
96992512	4	1	Child A		Follow orders.		4				
96992513	4	1	Child C		...		4				
96992514	4	1	Child B		That sounds scary, Grandpa...		4				
96992515	4	1	???		When the ship is sinking, the first thing you do is save yourself. Watch your surroundings carefully...		3				
96992516	3	1	Polard Instructor		Quiet! If even one person fails to complete the training... you'll all be punished!		3				
96992517	4	1	Child B		I don't want to train—! Please! Let me go—!		6				
96992518	3	1	Polard Instructor		Looks like somebody doesn't want to follow orders...		3				
96992519	3	1	Polard Instructor		Use your weapons to punish that deserter!		3				
96992520	4	1	Child A		Don't blame me...		3				
96992521	4	1	Child C		But we just became friends...		3				
96992522	4	1	Child D		Thank you for the candy...		3				
96992523	3	1	Polard Instructor		Polard doesn't keep dead weight!		4				
96992524	7	5	???		Carry out the mission. Don't think about anything—it's easier that way.		5				{1: '3'}
96992525	7	5	Polard Instructor		Anyone who attempts to escape will face severe punishment!		4				{1: '5'}
96992526	3	1	Polard Instructor		Why are you still hesitating?		2				
96992527	3	1	Polard Instructor		You there! Dispose of this trash. You know the price of disobedience!		4				
96992528	4	1	Child B		Don't kill me. I just gave you candy just now.		3				
96992529	3	1	Polard Instructor		The trash is gone—time to continue training!		4				
96992530	7	5	???		Day X, Rest Time: 1 minute remaining		5				{1: '3'}
96992531	3	1	???		Once, the main gate was <color=#ffff00>forced open during a power outage</color>. The room went pitch black—many people were crying in fear. That was fun...		6				
96992532	3	1	Child A		Flowers that don't behave get cut down.		4				
96992533	3	1	Child D		You want to defy the Instructor? That's suicide...		4				
96992534	7	5	???		Day X, Rest Time: 1 minute remaining		5				{1: '3'}
96992535	3	1	Polard Instructor		Break's over! Back to training!		4				
96992536	3	1	???		Your next task: Escape. You don't have much time.		5				
96992537	3	1	???		A dog has a keen nose, but can it unravel tangled mysteries? Or perhaps... It's time to show your fangs.		11				
96992538	3	1	???		What kind of reward do you want? Now, now... the sweet dream will continue.		7				
96992539	3	1	Child A		I don't know if I can hold on much longer.		4				
96992540	3	1	???		When that thing in your hands blows, who's to say you'll still be standing?		4				
96992541	3	1	???		Do you want the official answer, or the truth?		4				
96992542	3	1	Discord		Is this... an energy core? <color=#ffff00>When activated, it seems like it will generate a powerful pulse wave</color>		6				
96992543	3	1	Discord		This is the room's electrical panel. <color=#ffff00>If there's a way to destroy it...</color>		6

96992548	3	1	Discord		Shut up, you noisy illusion!		4				
96992549	3	1	Discord		I won't stay trapped in this cage anymore!		4				
96992550	3	1	???		Good. I like dogs that bite.		5				
96992551	7	5	???		Final Day		4				{1: '2'}
96992552	3	1	???		I'm glad to see you've been enjoying our little game so much. But all good things must come to an end.		4				
96992553	3	1	Polard Instructor		Your final training is to kill your comrades!		3				
96992554	3	1	???		You wouldn't raise those scissors against me, would you?		3				
96992555	3	1	???		Now, gaze into the abyss and become part of it...		4				
96992556	3	1	???		Tear them apart to your heart's content. This is your reward for trying so hard to please me.		4				
96992557	3	1	Discord		Focus. You're almost there.		5				
96992558	3	1	Discord		How much time... do I have left?		5				
96992559	3	1	Polard Instructor		Stand straight! Break's over. Back to training!		3				
150215071	3	1	Discord		It cannot be opened from this side		3				
150215072	7	5	Lilith		<color=#8B50F2>This is an order.\nCome! Let us dance together!</color>		8				{1: '5'}
150215073	3	1	Discord		Eleanor. So it really is you...		4				
150215074	3	1	Madam Monzano		Fool! I told you the deal is already done!		5				
150215075	3	1	Discord		It cannot be opened from this side.		3				
150215076	3	1	Discord		The door is locked.		3				
150215077	3	1	Discord		The door is blocked from the inside.		3				
150215078	3	1	Discord		The door is sealed by some kind of power.		3				
150215079	3	1	Lilith		I'll teach you not to be a coward who turns their back on evolution.		5				
1502150710	3	1	Discord		...Roger.		7				
1502150711	3	1	Madam Monzano		Just you wait—you'll see that you're nothing more than a disposable chip to her!		6				
1502150712	3	1	Lilith		Jump. That's an order.		5

1036011201	3	1	Liv		Commandant, please... stay safe.		4				
1036011202	3	1	Liv		These Hetero-Creatures... are they blocking our path? Who's controlling them...?		7				
1036011203	3	1	Liv		Their numbers keep growing... Melinoe, be careful.		8				
1036011204	3	1	Liv		There's a camp ahead... Maybe it has clues about the Commandant.		6				
1036011205	3	1	Liv		My new frame's starting to handle this terrain better.		5				
1036011206	3	1	Liv		Commandant...		3				
1036011207	3	1	Liv		My frame's recording more battle data...		5				
1036011208	3	1	Liv		Hm? What's this...		2				
1036011209	3	1	Liv		(Footprints... These must belong to the Commandant.)		3				
1036011210	3	1	Liv		(Did they go ahead?)		3				
1036011211	3	1	Liv		(This is definitely the right direction...)		3				
1036011212	3	1	Liv		(Hetero-Creatures... how did they end up here?)		3				
1036011213	3	1	Liv		How is this possible?!		3				
1036011214	3	1	Liv		We just need to hold out a little longer before the elevator arrives...		3				
1036022301	3	1	Liv		The access card for the mine elevator is here too. Let's get out of here.		3				
1036022302	3	1	Liv		A spider-like robot, probably once used for mineral detection. Looks abandoned for a while.		3				
1036022303	3	1	Liv		Strangely shaped minerals filled with chaotic Punishing signals.		3				
1036022304	3	1	Liv		Layer after layer of minerals wrap around egg-shaped crystals. One side is cracked open, as if something once hatched from within.		3				
1036022305	3	1	Liv		Unusual marks on the ground. It's unclear what kind of creature left them.		3				
1036022306	3	1	Liv		(This elevator requires an access card to operate...)		5				
1036022307	3	1	Liv		(An elevator access card left behind by an employee. It still seems usable.)		5				
1036022308	3	1	Liv		Ugh... thank goodness. My frame's still intact.		4				
1036022309	3	1	Liv		Is this... the bottom of the mine? I need to find a way back up fast. The Commandant's still above.		8				
1036022310	3	1	Liv		Is this... my weapon?		4				
1036022311	3	1	Liv		...Not the time for this. I need to find the Commandant first.		6				
1036022312	3	1	Liv		Strange marks... Were they from an explosion?		4				
1036022313	3	1	Liv		Good... the elevator still works.		5				
1036022314	3	1	Liv		Wait for me, Commandant. I'm on my way.		4
