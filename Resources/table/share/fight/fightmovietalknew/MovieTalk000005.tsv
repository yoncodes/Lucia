2088	3	1	Illusion:		Sometimes, things don't change due to individual will.		3

9001	3	1			When you throw a new variable into an old story, something interesting always happens.		6				
9002	3	1			I love seeing these little changes pop up.		3				
9003	3	1			Now... let's see...		4				
9004	3	1			"After adding this ""variable"", will this story... find a different voice?"		9				
9005	3	1	Narration		A human... has wandered into an unknown world.		5				
9006	3	1	Narration		They stand up...		2				
9007	3	1	Narration		Hmm... looks like they don't remember anything, and decide to explore ahead.		8				
9008	3	1	Narration		They don't seem to notice the ground, just walk through the passage and leave.		6				
9009	3	1	Narration		These bodies that are almost identical to them... are all lifeless. They're confused...		7				
9010	3	1	Narration		"Oh... it's Red Tide Projection. It always manages to hold onto some unexpected ""data""."		10				
9011	3	1	Lithos		Loki's head is severely damaged, her consciousness data couldn't be saved.		6				
9012	3	1	Researcher		Sorry, we've tried everything we could...		7				
9013	3	1	Lithos		Then... we'll need to try another way...		5				
9014	3	1	Narration		"They seem to have received some interesting information from the Red Tide Projection... is it about ""Lithos"" or ""Loki""?"		10				
9015	3	1	Narration		They don't seem interested in this place, and quickly leave the Red Tide area.		5				
9016	3	1	Narration		Why are they still here? They seem to want more information, but this is all the projection contains.		11				
9017	3	1	Narration		Around the corner, they see another Red Tide Projection... what new data does this one hold?		9				
9018	3	1	Lithos		I'm sorry, sir... I've lost the Gray Raven Commandant's exact location, and Cthylla went berserk from being awakened early.		10				
9019	3	1	Shorthalt		We're stuck! There's nothing but those monsters from earlier back there.		4				
9020	3	1	Shorthalt		Commandant, we need to get rid of her here! She's going to join Lithos and have us cornered if we let her get away now!		9				
9021	3	1	Lithos		Are you the Commandant the Gray Raven team is desperately searching for? Or just one of the five they don't care about?		11				
9022	3	1	Narration		The Red Tide Projection fades, and they seem to notice marks on the ground...		5				
9023	3	1	Narration		They're still not interested in what happened here... Really not going to take a look?		6				
9024	3	1	Narration		"Oh, they found the bloodstains... yes, those are traces left from the ""last"" anomaly."		10				
9025	3	1	Narration		They're sure they're on the right path, and decide to keep going.		5				
9026	3	1	Narration		Huh? They didn't notice the bloodstains on the ground? I think they should check it out... why not?		11				
9027	3	1	Narration		Oh, they're a very stubborn human... but maybe that's why they can...		5				
9028	3	1	Narration		They found the path and seem eager to leave this place...		5				
9029	3	1	Narration		They're spacing out... what are they thinking? Hoping for more information, or thinking about something else?		12				
9030	3	1	Narration		This place is like a huge maze to them, and they're trying to find their way across.		8				
9031	3	1	Narration		They realize it's the wrong way.		5				
9032	3	1	Narration		Hmm... why insist on going down this wrong path?		6				
9033	3	1	Narration		I think they should leave here and find the right path.		6				
9034	3	1	Narration		They're still waiting... waiting for a miracle? But waiting won't make miracles happen.		12				
9035	3	1	Narration		They seem to have decided to leave, hmm... I think that's the right decision.		7				
9036	3	1	Narration		Alright, I can't guess their intentions. They seem determined to leave here.		8				
9037	3	1	Narration		It's a new fork in the road, and they choose... the path down.		7				
9038	3	1	Narration		Hmm... is my memory failing? The way out should be down there, but maybe... they have their own ideas.		12				
9039	3	1	Narration		Going this way, they'll soon reach the real exit.		6				
9040	3	1	Narration		Oh, a new Red Tide Projection.		4				
9041	3	1	Lithos		Infected experiment... just destroy it.		5				
9042	3	1	Narration		"""Infected experiment""... do they realize that refers to them? Looks like they need to leave quickly."		10				
9043	3	1	Narration		Hmm... they don't seem interested in this Red Tide Projection either.		6				
9044	7	5			They still stepped onto that final path...		0				{1: '0.1'}
9045	3	1	Narration		Huh? What's this... They seem to have found something.		7				
9046	3	1	Narration		This is a new route... They're not familiar with it. Maybe they should go back and head towards the real exit below.		9				
9047	3	1	Narration		They seem to want to try a new route.		4				
9048	3	1	Narration		Unfortunately, their decision is wrong. Maybe they should go back and try another path.		8				
9049	3	1	Narration		Are they still waiting? But there are no more stories here.		6				
9050	3	1	Narration		"Hmm... is it a new ""anomaly""? Looks like something interesting is about to happen..."		8				
9051	3	1	Narration		They saw everything.		3				
9052	3	1	Narration		It's them... I think now... is not the time for them to be here.		11				
9053	3	1	Shorthalt		I remember Valeria gave me a whole pack, over a hundred pills, but I only remember eating two, and giving you one.		8				
9054	3	1	Noan		Agree to this deal, help Cthylla's womb break free, and protect the Commandant while leaving.		7				
9055	3	1	Noan		Give me the egg, only then can I suppress Cthylla from the inside, and use her protection to help you withstand the water pressure 5,000 meters below the deep sea.		10				
9056	3	1	Lithos		Once the last injection is finished, you'll only have 48 hours left to live. Even if you get back to the Babylonia immediately, they might not have the technology to save you.		14				
9057	3	1	???		Red Tide Projection... can record...		4				
9058	3	1	???		If... if you can see this...		4				
9059	3	1	The Merciful One		Sorry... leave this place... It is not... the right time for you to be here.		10				
9060	3	1	The Merciful One		You shouldn't be here yet... it's not time, Gray Raven...		8				
9061	3	1	【kuroname】		A decorative stand with a slot where something could be inserted.		4				
9062	3	1	【kuroname】		A door opens.		3				
9063	3	1	【kuroname】		The stand has strangely-shaped slots that might trigger some mechanism.		5				
9064	3	1	【kuroname】		Its shape resembles a key, perhaps it can be placed somewhere.		7				
9065	3	1	Narration		Where do they want to go?		2				
9066	3	1	【kuroname】		Uh... where is this place...		3

10001	3	1	【kuroname】		It's a bit early. Better wait here for a moment.		3				
10002	3	1	【kuroname】		This feeling...		3				
10003	3	1	Ishmael		"""Gray Raven"", I'm coming... ""Gray Raven""!"		3				
10004	3	1			Body scan results... just asleep?		4				
10005	3	1			"""Gray Raven""... wake up..."		4				
10006	3	1	Ishmael		You're awake. If the portable scanner hadn't shown nothing was wrong, I'd have taken you to medical.		9				
10007	3	1	Ishmael		It's okay.		2				
10008	3	1	Ishmael		You looked really uncomfortable just now. Did you have a bad dream?		3				
10009	3	1	【kuroname】		Can't remember. Just that I was running, and then you showed up.		4				
10010	3	1	Ishmael		You seem preoccupied lately. Can you tell me what's on your mind?		7				
10011	3	1	【kuroname】		If... you realized you were stuck in an endless loop, what would you do?		5				
10012	3	1	Ishmael		Are you there too?		2				
10013	3	1	Ishmael		As long as you're there, that's all that matters.		2				
10014	3	1	Ishmael		Hungry? I made some food.		5				
10015	3	1	【kuroname】		Sorry, this is a terrible date.		3				
10016	3	1	Ishmael		Just make it up next time.		6				
10017	3	1	【kuroname】		Has it really been... this long?		3				
10018	3	1	【kuroname】		Maybe...		3				
10019	3	1	【kuroname】		Thank you...		3				
10020	3	1	【kuroname】		I'd like to take a photo of you... as a keepsake.		4

11001	3	1	Selena		Dandelion, do you read me? Have you spotted the target?		3				
11002	3	1	Dandelion		N-not yet. I'm in the lounge on the right side. It's crowded here and I'm still looking... uh, sorry.		7				
11003	3	1	Selena		In that case, stick to the plan and check the room on the left.		4				
11004	3	1	Selena		The security system here is as sensitive as ever.		3				
11005	3	1	Selena		Dandelion, what's the situation on your end?		3				
11006	3	1	Dandelion		There seems to have been some commotion just now. Security personnel are trying to calm everyone down, and some of the corridors have been closed off.		7				
11007	3	1	Selena		Looks like we'll need to find another route.		2				
11008	3	1	Selena		Breaking through wouldn't be difficult, but it would cause a bigger commotion. Better to proceed with caution.		5				
11009	3	1	Selena		Dandelion is responsible for the area ahead. Time is limited, so let's prioritize other locations first.		5				
11010	3	1	Selena		No response... Has the security system locked it down completely?		4				
11011	3	1	Selena		The device here still seems to be operational.		3				
11012	3	1	Selena		This theater is a maze. If something goes wrong, guests can't easily escape.		5				
11013	3	1	Selena		Something doesn't seem right... Is that Lueya? I should confirm.		5				
11014	3	1	Selena		The placement of these objects seems a bit strange.		3				
11015	3	1	Selena		The posture of this plaster figure has been clearly distorted.		4				
11016	3	1	Selena		Pages are missing from the books here.		2				
11017	3	1	Selena		That doesn't seem right. Perhaps I should look around for more clues.		3				
11018	3	1	Selena		The sheet music is severely damaged, but it looks restorable.		4				
11019	3	1	Selena		Whew... that felt like a good performance.		2				
11020	3	1	Selena		Leave it to me.		3				
11021	3	1	Selena		Hmm... That should do it.		3				
11022	3	1	Selena		Jonathan... and Dandelion's here too.		2				
11023	3	1	Jonathan		...W-what is that?!		3				
11024	3	1	Selena		She's here! Dandelion, take Jonathan and go!		4				
11025	3	1	Dandelion		R-right! Got it!		2				
11026	3	1	Selena		I need to get to the second floor quickly. Is there anything... Ah, the lift from earlier!		6				
11027	3	1	Selena		I can't afford to linger here too long.		2

13003	3	1	Selena		Hmm... Looks like the door's jammed from the other side.		2				
13004	3	1	Selena		All the levers are disabled. I need to find the control center.		4				
13005	3	1	Selena		Some kind of audio recorder... All the notes are damaged. Do I need to play the corresponding melody?		7				
13006	3	1	Selena		I recognize this song.		2

13010	3	1	Selena		Strange... This decor feels more like a club. What's she hiding?		9				
13011	3	1	Selena		What's this? A hidden room...		5				
13012	3	1	Selena		The device is working properly. Looks like this is the place.		5				
13013	3	1	Selena		Should be all set now. I should head back to where I started.		5				
13014	3	1	Selena		It's working properly now.		5

18005	3	1	Liv		Watch out!		1.5				
18006	3	1	Liv		It's the lab's defense system... Must be running on backup power.		4				
18007	3	1	Liv		Those projections... are they recorders? What were they meant to capture?		6				
18008	1	1	Liv	501213	These look like scattered research notes... There might be more clues about this lab nearby. Let's take a look around, Commandant.		7				{4: '3', 5: '1', 6: '1'}
18009	3	1	Liv		Those marks... were they caused by an explosion?		5				
18010	3	1	Liv		These leftover supplies... some of them should still be usable.		5				
18011	3	1	Liv		...Looks like a resting camp left by the squad. Commandant, let's take a break.		4				
18012	3	1	Liv		Let's explore the area, Commandant. From what we've found so far, we need to locate the lab's power source...		7.5				
18013	3	1	Liv		These people... were they lab staff?		3				
18014	3	1	Liv		No, they don't look it. More like... residents from the conservation area.		5				
18015	1	1	Liv	501213	Are these... traces left by the Rodent Squad?		3				{4: '6', 5: '1', 6: '1'}
18016	1	1	Liv	501213	How could this happen... What really went on here?		2				{4: '6', 5: '1', 6: '1'}
18017	3	1	Liv		Commandant, here's the lab's power source! Let's switch it on and restore power to this area.		5				
18018	1	1	Liv	501213	Let's rest here for a bit, Commandant.		3				{4: '1', 5: '1', 6: '1'}
18019	3	1	Liv		This person... something's wrong. It's like they're being controlled, like a puppet…		7				
18020	3	1			I'm sorry... but without these supplies, we... we'll all die.		6				
18021	3	1			Food. I need food. Food, food, food, food, food... MY food!		6				
18022	1	1			Heh, I have to survive...		4				{5: '1', 6: '1'}
