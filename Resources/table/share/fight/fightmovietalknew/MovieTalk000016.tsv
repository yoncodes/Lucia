995011901	3	1	Hanying		This is... Veronica's dream? It seems to be rejecting outsiders subconsciously.		7				
995011902	3	1	Hanying		This data might bring me deeper into her mind, but the resistance will also become stronger.		6				
995011903	3	1	Hanying		Perhaps there are more dream shards here. I should explore this place.		4				
995011904	3	1	Hanying		Is this... SDC-39? The kin of... the last Hanged Man?		9				
995011905	3	1	SDC-39		Space—far away from wars and the Punishing Virus. The magnetic accelerator rail was built because of this dream.		13				
995011906	3	1	SDC-39		"""The bridge to heaven."" Is this why it's called Bifrost...?"		9				
995011907	3	1	SDC-39		When it's fixed, mechanoids and humans will be able to travel to the stars together...		9				
995011908	3	1	SDC-39		I look forward to that day.		4				
995011909	3	1	Hanying		No! I must have triggered the defense mechanism here!		4				
995011910	3	1	Hanying		If I probe further, the dream's resistance will grow even stronger. But I can't stop here.		6				
995011911	3	1	SDC-39		They said I needed to shut down for a while due to some problems in my programming, but with the ravage of Punishing, humanity is still in danger.		12				
995011912	3	1	SDC-39		But with the ravage of Punishing, humanity is still in danger.		4				
995011913	3	1	SDC-39		I can't wait anymore... I must finish repairing Bifrost as soon as possible...		6				
995011914	3	1	Veronica		I don't understand... Why do humans deserve your sacrifice?		6				
995011915	3	1	Hanying		Something strange is happening here... Is it because of SDC-39's glitches?		5				
995011916	3	1	Data Surge		Getting close to the core of the dream. It's only going to be even more dangerous there... Still, I must find the source of all this strangeness.		8				
995011917	4	1	Data Figure		Why would mechanoids store messages humans can understand in their memory? Is it meant for humans to read?		3				
995011918	4	1	Data Figure		A mechanoid with such thoughts must be destroyed. We have plenty more, so it doesn't matter if we lose this one.		8				
995011919	4	1	Data Figure		WARNING: Unknown intruder detected. Initiating virus elimination protocol—		8				
995011920	3	1	SDC-39		Something made me very happy today. At a place far from here, I got to meet some mechanoid friends from the Church of Machina.		9				
995011921	3	1	SDC-39		"They even gave me a name, ""The Hanged Man"". I really like it, even though I don't understand what it means."		12				
995011922	3	1	SDC-39		If we're lucky, we might even welcome someone new. Her name is Veronica. We ought to be friends with her.		13				
995011923	3	1	Veronica		...I wish I had made it in time.		3				
995011924	3	1	SDC-39		I need to do a routine inspection. They said that other mechanoids wouldn't have to do it if I did.		10				
995011925	3	1	SDC-39		It's okay. Perhaps my program errors will be fixed afterward.		9				
995011926	3	1	SDC-39		But the Bifrost isn't done. When you reach the stars with humans, don't forget to send a photo back to Earth.		15				
995011927	3	1	SDC-39		Me? Maybe I can't come with you...		7				
995011928	3	1	Veronica		Don't go, 39.		3				
995011929	3	1	Hanying		SDC-39... Is this how the last Hanged Man died? Protecting other mechanoids... while perishing at the hands of humans.		11				
995011930	3	1	Hanying		If this is why Veronica is angry with humans...		9				
995011931	3	1	■■		Hah, the human-loving traitor...		5				
995011932	4	1	Data Figure		Lock onto the virus source. Destroy, destroy, destroy—		3				
995011933	3	1	Hanying		The dream is rejecting me again!		3				
995011934	3	1	Hanying		That's...!		1				
995011935	3	1	Hanying		...! I knew it. Someone was behind that strangeness I felt!		6				
995011936	3	1	Hanying		The data hasn't stopped increasing. Is this... as far as I go?		7				
995011801	3	1	Hanying		Finally made it. This is where Commandant was trapped.		4				
995011802	3	1	Hanying		"This feels familiar... Right, I've been here in Veronica's ""dream"". Is the power still down...? It's so dark here."		12				
995011803	3	1	Hanying		Commandant and Liv are definitely here.		2				
995011804	3	1	Hanying		Alright, hurry up and get to the commandant.		4				
995011805	3	1	Hanying		Commandant, Liv! Are you okay?		4				
995011806	3	1	Hanying		Commandant, Liv! Are you okay?		4				
995011807	3	1	Liv		Hanying? Thank you for your help. There are still quite a few guards around here. Let's fight together.		7				
995011808	3	1	Liv		Hanying? We've been trapped for a while now... Thank you for your help. We'll...		10				
995011809	3	1	Hanying		Don't overexert yourself, Liv. Leave it to me!		4				
995011810	3	1	Hanying		Commandant, Liv... This place has so much abnormal data... I even found Hyperreal's frame data here.		10				
995011811	3	1	Liv		Lee? What's going on here, Hanying?		6				
995011812	3	1	Hanying		Someone is after Hyperreal's power and is likely trying to replicate his data. It's a long story. Let's get out of here first.		9				
995011813	3	1	Liv		It will be safer if we stick together. Commandant, let's go with Hanying.		5				
995011814	3	1	Hanying		Liv, since your frame is more damaged, focus on ensuring your safety and Commandant's... Leave the rest to me.		10				
995011815	3	1	Liv		Okay... Please be careful and don't get yourself hurt.		4				
995011816	3	1	Hanying		(Breathy sound)		15				
995011817	3	1	■■		Hmph...		7				
995011818	3	1	■■		Hahaha, even though I didn't manage to replicate all the data, this power is strong enough!		10				
995011819	3	1	Hanying		Commandant, he copied Lee's data. He's not Lee!		4				
995011820	3	1	Broadcast		Anomaly detected in the cargo area. Unable to connect with other areas—		3				
31010501	3	1	Lucia		I gotta figure out where things went wrong... before Constellia gets flooded!		6				
31010502	3	1	Cradle		Great to see you again, Lucia. I see you're doing a treasure hunt?		6				
31010503	3	1	Lucia		This isn't the only place the Red Tide is coming out of... She really is trying to flood this city.		6				
31010504	3	1	Cradle		Making headway there? Found where things went wrong? Are you able to fix those cracks even if you find them?		12				
31010505	3	1	Cradle		Or, do you plan on asking your commdandant to beg Chaos, whom you hate the most, for help?		9				
31010506	3	1	Lucia		This door is locked, but there should be a control panel nearby.		4				
31010507	3	1	Lucia		The door is unlocked. I need to stop Cradle from strengthening the Red Tide.		5				
31010508	3	1	Cradle		Say, I can make the Red Tide go away a little, but you'll have to either catch Chaos for me or lure her to where I want you to.		15				
31010509	3	1	Lucia		I refuse. Whether it's you, Chaos, or that agent, I'm not letting any one of you off the hook.		8				
31010510	3	1	Cradle		Sure. Go ahead and kill me here, but of course, do keep in mind that we're still in the Hetero Tower's range of influence here.		15				
31010511	3	1	Cradle		You can kill me as many times as you want, but I'll never really die.		6				
31012501	3	1	Lucia		"So this is the way out of the Fog... No, it's similar to the Hetero Tower in terms of nature and function, except it's more like a ""bridge"" in comparison with the Hetero Tower."		12				
31012502	3	1	"""Shadows"" of the Past"		This is the rule we set. This is our safety zone. These... our wills... are the only things we were able to leave you with.		13				
31012503	3	1	"""Shadows"" of the Past"		Nemo, leave this world. Find a way to completely eliminate Agent Zero.		8				
31012504	3	1	"""Shadows"" of the Past"		Do me a favor—save that world that has yet to be destroyed, save those who still wish to live.		8				
31012505	3	1	"""Shadows"" of the Past"		Forget about us, don't try to save us, and don't waste your chance to turn back time on us.		11				
31012506	3	1	Lucia		Their rules still protect this place. I'm sorry, but I must pass through.		5				
31012507	3	1	Lucia		There's no point in prolonging this fight... I need to get out first!		4				
31012508	3	1	Lucia		"This ""bridge"" looks to be made from those remains."		6				
31012509	3	1	"""Shadows"" of the Past"		Dominik has left, but he was prepared... As expected of our hero.		9				
31012510	3	1	"""Shadows"" of the Past"		I can only remain. The exit is just below.		5				
31012511	3	1	"""Shadows"" of the Past"		Keep going, Nemo. If you seek atonement, fulfill your father's final wish... It's what we all hoped for, too.		14				
31012512	3	1	Lucia		"This ""bridge"" is rejecting me. Hurry across!"		4				
31012513	3	1	Lucia		Commandant... Finally, I...!		4				
502100401	3	1	Yata		The school buildings... sure look miserable. But there is no time to be sad. I gotta find Shiva.		7				
502100402	3	1	Yata		The Corrupted? Did they all get drawn here when the door was opened?		4				
502100403	3	1	Yata		The Corrupted are probably gonna swarm up on me if I try to force my way through... I need to be as quiet as I can to make sure Shiva is safe.		10				
502100404	3	1	Yata		...Comms is back up? Shiva? Valeria?		5				
502100405	3	1	■■		Hah.		2				
502100406	3	1	Yata		Who's that? Stop that and just talk already! Damn it...		7				
502100407	3	1	Yata		I can hear someone singing... Wait, is this... the song we all sang together at the graduation ceremony?		8				
502100408	3	1	Yata		The sound of a trumpet... Tsk, nice try trying to fool me here. Bet you're in the broadcasting room.		5				
502100409	3	1	Yata		Half of this picture is missing. Is this... a group picture of the choir? Seems like someone left it here on purpose.		6				
502100410	3	1	Yata		It's empty... Guess someone is hiding whatever was inside?		3				
502100411	3	1	It's familiar.		The missing half of this picture... What exactly are you trying to tell me?		4				
502100412	3	1	Yata		Seems like the school buildings are back to normal. Guess I can only count on myself now without Valeria around.		7				
502100413	3	1	"""Classmate's"" Shadow"		Yata, over here.		3				
502100414	3	1	"""Classmate's"" Shadow"		"The rehearsal is about to begin but ""she"" isn't here yet. Can you help us look for her?"		6				
502100415	3	1	"""Classmate's"" Shadow"		By the way, her classroom might be a little difficult to find. Normally, you'd go up... but hurry down if you run into anything weird.		12				
502100416	3	1	Yata		So people normally would go up, but they come back down when they run into something weird... Can things get any weirder than they already are?		11				
502100417	3	1	Yata		Wait, I'm back to where I started. So I'm supposed to go up but come back down if I run into something weird... Did I screw up somewhere?		10				
502100418	3	1	Yata		Her seat is in the third row of the third column... Wait... isn't this my seat? Which means... I'm the one who's absent?		12				
502100419	3	1	"""Classmate's"" Shadow"		Great, everyone's here. Let's get started!		5				
502100420	3	1	"""Classmate's"" Shadow"		C'mon, Yata. All right, look at the camera.		5				
502100421	3	1	"""Classmate's"" Shadow"		Her classroom might be a little difficult to find. Normally, you'd go up... but hurry down if you run into anything weird.		10				
502100422	4	1	"""Classmate's"" Shadow"		I hope I don't get dragged by weird people into watching terrible alien movies all afternoon during the school festival this year.		4				
502100423	4	1	"""Classmate's"" Shadow"		Haha, you mean that senior who's always going on about finding aliens?		4				
502100424	4	1	"""Classmate's"" Shadow"		Zzz... Huh? Oh, the school festival... Wish there was a napping club... Zzzz...		5

502100428	3	1	Yata		No time to waste, let's keep going!		3				
502100429	3	1	"Fallen ""Classmate"""		Weird... Why am I here?		4				
502100430	3	1	"Fallen ""Classmate"""		I remember I was moving stuff and passed by the diving club yesterday. I was thirsty so I asked them for some oolong tea... And then...		8				
502100431	3	1	"Fallen ""Classmate"""		Weird, why can't I remember? Whatever, I'll just sleep a bit more... My head hurts...		7				
502100432	3	1	"""Classmate's"" Shadow"		It's our final rehearsal! Let's get everyone together for a group photo before we start!		8				
502100433	3	1	"""Classmate's"" Shadow"		Finally finished cleaning... But wait, this is supposed to be a music classroom. Why are the shelves filled with expensive tea sets and dessert plates?		10				
502100434	3	1	"""Classmate's"" Shadow"		I found all these weird outfits while cleaning the classroom. Could the seniors have left them behind?		7				
502100435	3	1	"""Classmate's"" Shadow"		I heard the last club that used this music room always performed in bizarre costumes, but they were super popular!		10				
502100436	3	1	Yata		Four words seem to be carved into this desk...		3				
502100437	3	1			Homeland! Of! The! King!		4				
502100438	3	1	"""Classmate's"" Shadow"		Hey hey, have you heard of the girl ghost in the bathroom? I just passed by that locked bathroom and I swear I heard someone crying!		10				
502100439	3	1	"""Classmate's"" Shadow"		Oh yeah, I've heard of that. Whenever there's a big school event, you can hear crying coming from that bathroom...		8				
502100440	3	1	Yata		(Crying from the bathroom? Are these kinds of urban legends still a thing?)		5				
502100441	3	1	"""Classmate's"" Shadow"		*Sob* *Sob*... What do I do... I can't finish it again... *Sob*...		5				
502100442	3	1	"""Classmate's"" Shadow"		Huh? Who's out there? Go away!		3				
502100443	3	1	Yata		(Can't finish... What exactly can't they finish?)		5				
502100444	3	1	"""Classmate's"" Shadow"		The school festival is coming up, but the event plan still hasn't been finalized... I hope that kid's okay. She's probably hiding somewhere crying again...		10				
502100445	3	1	"""Classmate's"" Shadow"		Ah, so she's hiding in the bathroom. She's the type who keeps her troubles to herself... Well, this time, let's work together to complete the plan.		10				
502100446	3	1	Yata		(So the ghost crying in the bathroom... was just because the plan isn't finished...)		6				
502100447	3	1	"""Classmate's"" Shadow"		The school festival is coming up, but the event plan still hasn't been finalized... I hope that kid's okay. She's probably hiding somewhere crying again...		10				
502100448	3	1	"""Classmate's"" Shadow"		I can't find her anywhere... Maybe she's already finished the plan?		8				
502100449	3	1	"""Classmate's"" Shadow"		They're coordinating all the club activities tomorrow though... Do you think she'll make it?		4				
502100450	3	1	"""Classmate's"" Shadow"		Looks like the school festival will have to be postponed...		3

995007304	3	1	Jetavie		Huff... Before that happens, I'll fight my own way out.		7

995007306	3	1	Classmate's Projection		Stay in this safe haven, with us...		7				
995007307	3	1	Classmate's Projection		Let go of those emotions, and you'll no longer suffer.		7				
995007308	3	1	???		Look at you, Jetavie... battered, broken. What's even the point of living in a world without the Chosen One?		8				
995007309	3	1	Jetavie		...Not yet. There are still people to save. I need to go back.		7				
995007310	3	1	Jetavie		The Matrix again? Is this a low-power hallucination...?		7				
995007311	3	1	???		Isn't this exactly where you've been wanting to return?		6				
995007312	3	1	Jetavie		Is that... the beacon up ahead? Looks so silly...		8				
995007313	3	1	???		Had enough yet? Still don't know when to quit?		6				
995007314	3	1	Jetavie		I can't stop now. That beacon... still needs me...		6				
995007315	3	1	Jetavie		I've bought them enough time... right? Not... the worst way to go down, after all.		14				
995007316	3	1	???		You're lying.		3				
502130801	3	1	Jetavie		Took you long enough.		2				
502130802	3	1	Jetavie		"Before I took my first sip, I made a little bet with myself—""How many pearls will I slurp up before you get here?"""		9999				
502130803	3	1	Jetavie		I don't remember. This bubble tea isn't sweet enough to trigger my taste sensors.		8				
502130804	3	1	Jetavie		"Oh, but you know what? Your face was totally saying, ""How does such a romantic place exist in this run-down neighborhood?"""		11				
502130805	3	1	Jetavie		You walked straight toward me, while your eyes kept scanning the surroundings...		7				
502130806	3	1	Jetavie		You were moving slowly, your upper body tense like you were ready to spring into action any second... Heh, my visual module has caught all of it.		9999				
502130807	3	1	Jetavie		Why? Because it's very entertaining to watch.		6				
502130808	3	1	Jetavie		But you really plan to stay this alert the whole time at a bubble tea place?		9999				
502130809	3	1	Jetavie		That's so you.		4				
502130810	3	1	Jetavie		Oh? You want to keep me safe?		4				
502130811	3	1	Jetavie		Your combat ability is pretty impressive as a human, I'll give you that. But still, you can't really compete with a mechanoid, can you?		9999				
502130812	3	1	Jetavie		Always acting so tough... Why not let me protect you for once, hmm?		7				
502130813	3	1	Jetavie		Look, if I can't get you to relax and enjoy bubble tea with me, then meeting here is pointless.		9				
502130814	3	1	Jetavie		So, I've already checked every inch of this place and turned over every stone before you got here.		7				
502130815	3	1	Jetavie		I've swept the whole place—inside, outside, floor to roof. Nothing weird, no interruptions. Not even a fly can get through.		13				
502130816	3	1	Jetavie		But... are you really okay with this? Dropping your guard so easily... If something does happen here, no one's coming to save you, you know?		9999				
502130817	3	1	Jetavie		Of course. Nothing else can threaten you now... except me.		8				
502130818	3	1	Jetavie		In this lonely little corner of the world... I'm the ONLY ONE who gets to hurt you.		7				
502130819	3	1	Jetavie		And yet here you are, waltzing right into the devil's den like a clueless hero who trusted the wrong person. Tell me... aren't you afraid I'll eat you whole?		9999				
502130820	3	1	Jetavie		Oh?		2				
502130821	3	1			(Jetavie's expression suddenly turns somewhat frightening as she slowly leans in closer, gently sniffing a few times.)		6				
502130822	3	1	Jetavie		(Sniffs lightly)		2				
502130823	3	1	Jetavie		(Rawr!)		2				
502130824	3	1			(Then, she gracefully returns to her seat, watching you with great interest.)		6				
502130825	3	1	Jetavie		But... I'm dying to know... what could possibly make you this bold?		9999				
502130826	3	1			(She had countless opportunities to harm you, but not only did she refrain from doing so, but she chose to protect you instead.)		7				
502130827	3	1	Jetavie		Oh? Looks like someone's fallen under my spell...		4				
502130828	3	1	Jetavie		Hehe, are you guessing how likely I'd throw you under the bus? Too late though—even if you raise your guard, there's no running away now.		10				
502130829	3	1	Jetavie		You're still way too useful to me. I won't let a single scratch touch you... until I've squeezed out every last drop of your value.		10				
502130830	3	1	Jetavie		So why don't you just relax and share some bubble tea with me?		4				
502130831	3	1	Jetavie		By the way, do you know why I picked this place?		9999				
502130832	3	1	Jetavie		This store's dreamy vibe totally makes it the perfect spot to set up a signal source. Who'd suspect such a charming little spot?		11				
502130833	3	1	Jetavie		But like I said, I've turned this place inside out... and still found nothing. Not a trace of the signal source here.		9999				
502130834	3	1	Jetavie		A nice, bright spot like this makes it much easier to capture all your expressions. Thanks to you, my visual module has collected some really lovely footage.		11				
502130835	3	1	Jetavie		The lighting here is so romantic. It could even make a serious dummy like you look absolutely dazzling. Do you think this place has magic or something?		9999				
502130836	3	1	Jetavie		You don't think so? To me, just sitting here with you like this... this quiet moment is magical enough by itself.		9999				
502130837	3	1	Jetavie		Right now, staring at this bubble tea... the sounds of battle with the Corrupted just fade away.		10				
502130838	3	1	Jetavie		This is the magic a simple day like this truly holds for me.		6				
502130839	3	1	Jetavie		Sigh... I'd love to stay longer, but that signal source won't find itself.		8				
502130840	3	1	Jetavie		Wait, if I'm right, you didn't tell the old hag that you took us away from Gestrig, did you?		10				
502130841	3	1	Jetavie		Are you sure it's okay to be lounging around chatting with me... in the very place she forbade you to go?		9999				
502130842	3	1	Jetavie		Sigh.		2				
502130843	3	1	Jetavie		Hmph...		2				
502130844	3	1	Jetavie		White mentioned a bubble tea shop in her diary—should be in that alley over there. Let's check it out together when you're free. I'll wait there.		10				
502130845	3	1	Commandant		...A shopping mall? Seems like there are still many stores in business here.		6				
502130846	4	1	Crouching Resident		Bad decision... Shouldn't have drunk so much bubble tea, urgh...		8				
502130847	4	1	Roadside Resident		Is this some kind of performance art? They've been standing there for hours.		8				
502130848	4	1	Onlooking Resident		I heard they're imitating some popular band from the Golden Age.		5				
502130849	4	1	Residents Pointing to the Distance		Still no access to the Inner Ring... Oh well, it's just ruins anyway.		5				
502130850	4	1	Conversing Resident		Why bother going to those ruins? Didn't the company strictly prohibit it?		5				
502130851	4	1	Conversing Resident		I... I swear I won't do it again...		5				
502130852	4	1	Resident with Injured Elbow		My arm hurts... Last night, I somehow got beaten up by someone clinging to a chandelier.		6				
502130853	4	1	Resident with Injured Elbow		I kindly reminded him not to make a racket in the middle of the night...		4				
502130854	4	1	Resident with Injured Elbow		They suddenly charged at me, yelling something about a band and calling it stupid. What a bizarre encounter.		6				
35010101	3	1	Bianca		Cough... This place... It's...		4				
35010102	3	1	Bianca		...The aquarium?		3				
35010103	3	1	Scavenger		Help! Someone... Help...!		5				
35010104	3	1	Bianca		...Ah! How is this possible...		4				
35010105	3	1	Bianca		This is the aquarium, but... how did I end up here? ...Better see what's further in.		10				
35010106	3	1	Bianca		The Red Tide is... gone? I...		6				
35010107	3	1	Bianca		That's... me? But why would I be here in the aquarium...		7				
35010108	3	1	Bianca		Scavengers? Scarlet... Scarlet Revelation... Right, I'm here to rescue the Scarlet Revelation and Chiko...		12				
35010109	3	1	Scavenger		Salvation... Happiness... Lady Revelationist...		6				
35010110	3	1	Scavenger		No, it shouldn't be... Keller! It's me! Salvation... shouldn't be like this...		9				
35010111	3	1	Scavenger		The rescue team... It's the rescue team! Someone! Help! HELP!!		7				
35010112	3	1	Scavenger		The gate... the whole passage is blown apart! Damn it, we're stuck here! There's no way out!		8				
35010113	3	1	Purifying Force Member		It's an Ascendant!		2				
35010114	3	1	Purifying Force Member		CAPTAIN—!!		1				
35010115	3	1	Bianca		Ugh...		6				
35010116	3	1			Bianca... Witch...		6				
35010117	3	1			Come... Eat... Devour...		9				
35010118	3	1	Bianca		...Get away from me!		1				
35010119	3	1	Bianca		That voice... it's coming from there...		4				
35010120	3	1	Bianca		M.I.N.D... This place is...		5				
35011101	3	1	Bianca		Did Commandant go in this direction...? This place...		6				
35011102	3	1	Bianca		These traces... The Phantom Tracer from the airdrop capsule might give me a lead.		7				
35011103	3	1	Bianca		...Bloodstains and footprints... all covered by the Red Tide. Commandant was here. But this area's too wide. I need more leads...		10				
35011104	3	1	Bianca		The monitoring room... Maybe it's still operational?		4				
35011105	3	1	Bianca		If it is, I might be able to find Commandant's trail from the surveillance feeds.		2				
35011106	3	1	Bianca		The power's been cut... The Ascendants must be behind this.		4				
35011107	3	1	Bianca		The aquarium should have backup power devices nearby... I should take a look around.		6				
35011108	3	1	Bianca		Good thing the Ascendants didn't have time to destroy the backup devices here.		4				
35011109	3	1	Bianca		Power's back. I need to hurry and find Commandant...		4				
35011110	3	1	Bianca		...The Red Tide?! They actually hid such a massive amount of the Red Tide here...		7				
35011111	3	1	Bianca		This is it. Commandant, hang in there.		4				
35011112	3	1			Through the Phantom Tracer, you glimpse scattered fragments of images...		4				
35011113	3	1	Bianca		There are many items here that might still be useful... Found it! The system's backup power source is right here.		4				
35011114	3	1			A pile of miscellaneous items, already corroded by the Red Tide. They look unusable.		4				
35011115	3	1			A pile of unwanted equipment and discarded items from the aquarium's previous renovations. The system's backup power is not here. Better look elsewhere.		4				
35011116	3	1	Bianca		The Phantom Tracer is reacting again!		4				
35011117	3	1			Figure's Dialogue - 1		4				
35011118	3	1			Figure's Dialogue - 2		4				
35011119	3	1	Bianca		The monitoring room is up ahead.		4				
35011120	3	1			No time to turn back. The monitoring room is just ahead.		2				
35011401	3	1	Bianca		The way back is completely cut off... Commandant, do we push forward?		4				
35011402	3	1	Bianca		The collapse is speeding up... We can't hold here. Let's get out first!		4				
35011403	3	1	Bianca		The exit should be just ahead... Commandant, I'll clear the way, and you handle the enemies behind. Let's push through in one go.		6				
35011404	3	1	Bianca		Ground's still collapsing... Commandant, this way!		4				
35011405	3	1	Bianca		Be careful.		1				
35011406	3	1	Bianca		We're almost there.		2				
35011407	3	1	Bianca		...Commandant, this is the exit.		3				
95007701	3	1	Dolores		"Veronica, this time I've brought you a real ""treat"" of an ""opponent""... What do you say? Aren't you pumped?"		12				
95007702	3	1	Veronica		You... Why you?!		6				
95007703	3	1	Dolores		"Heh, is this what you call a ""heartfelt reunion""?"		5

95007720	3	1	Veronica		Stop slinking around like a scared little rat in the shadows.		4				
95007721	3	1	Dolores		Veronica, you've finally graced me with your presence.		6				
95007722	3	1	Dolores		I've been looking forward to this moment for ages.		6

502161102	3	1	Veronica		Who's there?!		2				
502161103	3	1	???		"How pathetic, Veronica. ""She"" really pulled one over on you, didn't she?"		6
