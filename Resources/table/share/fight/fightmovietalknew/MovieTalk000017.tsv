969924021	3	1	Nanami		Found ya! Haicma, over here!		3				
969924022	3	1	Haicma		Nanami, watch out for the mutated Red Tide.		2				
969924023	3	1	Nanami		Here I come!		2				
969924024	3	1	Nanami		Opening Lines		2				
969924025	3	1	Nanami		Hey! Hello? Get yourself together. Are you feeling okay?		4				
969924026	3	1	Carson		Cough... T-The rest of my squad needs help! Please...		4				
969924027	3	1	Carson		I asked them to leave without me, but this place is full of those monsters. Everywhere! They're right over there! L-Let me go with you guys!		7				
969924028	3	1	Nanami		Don't worry! Nanami will find them!		2				
969924029	3	1	Haicma		Activating tactical circuit... Scanning begins... Nanami, there are traces left by humans over there.		8				
969924030	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR6Yongyechao1.png	Ah, a crashed vehicle! They must have fought here...		4				
969924031	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR6Yongyechao1.png	Footprints! They were here!		4				
969924032	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR6Yongyechao1.png	"The Red Tide... is still ""evolving""..."		4				
969924033	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR6Yongyechao1.png	The footprints go that way. Haicma, let's go!		4				
969924034	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/HakamaNormal02.png	The mutated Red Tide has already infiltrated this tunnel,		3				
969924050	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/HakamaNormal02.png	The probability of collapse stands at 84.26%.		4				
969924035	2	1	Haicma	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/HakamaNormal02.png	Nanami, watch out!		3				
969924036	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR6Yongyechao1.png	This place could collapse further...		3				
969924051	2	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR6Yongyechao1.png	Let's hurry out of this tunnel! Come on!		3				
969924037	3	1	Nanami		The traces start splitting up here... Let's look around! They must be nearby!		6				
969924038	3	1	Haicma		No traces of Constructs detected in that area. Let's investigate the other direction.		6				
969924039	3	1	Carson		No, no, no... Captain... Captain!!!		3				
969924040	3	1	Nanami		...How could this be?		2				
969924041	3	1	Nanami	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR6Yongyechao3.png	Something's off... I've never seen a Red Tide like this...		3				
969924042	3	1	Haicma		The concentration of the Punishing Virus is higher within this Red Tide. Please proceed with caution.		3				
969924043	3	1	Carson		Gilly... Gilly!!		3				
969924044	3	1	Nanami		It's... a newborn Hetero-Creature...		3				
969924045	3	1	Nanami		Haicma, keep them safe! I'm taking on this big guy here!		4				
969924046	3	1	Nanami		Phew... Thank God that wasn't its final form... Are you all okay?		6				
969924047	3	1	Carson		Cough... Thank you, guys... Gilly, hurry and contact Babylonia...		5				
969924048	3	1	Nanami		Not just yet. Let's make our way out of here first. I'm not up for another fight with that big guy.		5				
969924049	3	1	Haicma		The starship docking port is open and ready for evacuation.		4				
150211121	3	1	Broadcast		Welcome to the San Lorenzo Entertainment Park. Here, you can taste paradise within reach.		7				
150211122	3	1	Madam Monzano		Hmm... the tequila's overpowering. This doesn't feel like Eleanor's usual touch.		10				
150211123	3	1	Guest		7... 7... 7! Yes! I hit the jackpot!		6				
150211124	3	1	Guest		Let's see... how is this even possible?! The last one has to be a winner... nope, not that either! Damn it, that was my last credit!		14				
150211125	3	1	Guest		I don't recall mechanoids being among the prizes? (Screams) Ah, they've all gone haywire! Run for your lives!		9				
150211126	3	1	Madam Monzano		Tch, these things can't control themselves... even though I put memory locks on them.		5				
150211127	3	1	Madam Monzano		Calling military command, there's a riot at the entertainment park. Are you all deaf? Deploy the Task Force, now!		6				
150211128	3	1	Madam Monzano		Eleanor, control the crowd, neutralize the threats!		3				
150211129	3	1	Lilith		As you wish. Those who break the rules must face the consequences.		7				
150211991	3	1	Madam Monzano		The rogue Constructs triggered a quarantine lockdown! Eleanor, head to the control room and lift the emergency lockdown. Clear a path for reinforcements!		7				
150211992	3	1	Lilith		The elevators are completely locked down... Quarantine protocol? Heh. Babylonia really thought of everything.		10				
150211993	3	1	Lilith		Hmm? The control room door's open... looks like someone's inviting me to play.		8				
150211994	3	1	Lilith		"So-called self-imposed confinement, how fitting. My dear Aunt, you never seemed to grasp the meaning of ""selection""."		11				
150211995	3	1	?? in the Mind		Are you willing to rot in this poisonous stew? Let's break out of here together!		6				
150211996	3	1	Lilith		Don't get ahead of yourself. A clueless pawn who doesn't know their place has no business inviting me.		9				
150211997	3	1	Madam Monzano		You ungrateful wretch! Everything you have, I gave you! Even that frame!		7				
150211998	3	1	Voice in the Mind		Tyrannical ruler, stumbling block on the path to evolution... what's the difference? That's it, kill her! Remove the obstacle!		11				
150211999	3	1	Lilith		Good card games are always fleeting. Enjoy your little game in hell.		7				
1502119910	3	1	Madam Monzano		What took you so long? I'll go up and secure the area; you cover my back!		6				
1502119911	3	1	Lilith		Did you hear that? You ruined Aunt's plans... you pesky fleas!		6				
1502119912	3	1	Lilith		Yes, let them live in harmless lies... it'll give them a bliss even death can't take away.		12				
1502119913	3	1	Lilith		The elevator's back online. To lay your secrets bare like this... Aunt's habit of underestimating people hasn't changed a bit.		10				
1502119914	3	1	Elevator Announcement		San Lorenzo Entertainment Park, your paradise within reach. Welcome, let's continue our unfinished game.		10				
1502119915	3	1	Lilith		I'll give you credit, your persistence is something. Just remember, play nice, but play to win.		9				
1502119916	3	1	Lilith		What riot? This is a celebration! How can we not reward the children who shattered all the false rules?		13				
150211131	3	1	Elevator Announcement		Destination floor: Experiment Facility.		4				
150211132	3	1	Corrupted Construct		There's only one way to freedom!		5				
150211133	3	1	Lilith		Lifting the lockdown was just a little favor. Keep running, sweetheart?		6				
150211134	3	1	Timid ???		No! They're all dead... but we can still escape! This isn't home!		5				
150211135	3	1	Construct Data 1		Recall Experiment 1: Upon the Punishing infection, the experimental subject's personality is automatically uploaded to the central server for host body reassignment.		12				
150211136	3	1	Construct Data 2		Recall Experiment, No. 117: The frame identifies as the personality of Zero, an experimental subject confirmed deceased.		9				
150211137	3	1	Construct Data 3		Recall Experiment, No. 129: Reassignment error, Zero's personality exhibits infection attributes.		10				
150211138	3	1	Construct Data 4		Recall Experiment, No. 999: I am Lloyd.		8				
150211139	3	1	Timid Lloyd		There's only one way! Up, up!		4				
1502111310	3	1	Lilith		Hold your horses... I want to see what Aunt's been cooking up with my own eyes.		7				
1502111311	3	1	Lilith		Go up any higher... and you'll be knocking on Babylonia's sky dome, you know?		7				
1502111312	3	1	Lloyd		I am Lloyd! Enemies of freedom will fall before the collective will!		7				
1502111313	3	1	Timid Lloyd		We'll see each other again in the sunlight!		7				
1502111314	3	1	Lilith		"Backup consciousness, resist the Punishing Virus infection... Heh heh, that's a ""genius"" solution..."		9				
75381101	3	1	Madam Monzano's Phantom		Just a little more... if I perfect the internal shielding, plus the memory transfer, I'll ace the selection!		9				
75381102	3	1	Inner Phantom		Utter rubbish!		3				
75381103	3	1	Vonnegut's Phantom		No need to waste time on the losers... are you ready for the final exam?		6				
1502111318	3	1	Vonnegut		Painful, isn't it? The savagery that shreds sanity apart is the true face of the Ascension-Network.		8				
1502111319	3	1	Lilith		Painful screams		4				
1502111320	3	1	Vonnegut		You've laid yourself bare, good...		4				
1502111321	3	1	Inner Phantom		But only those whose desires can survive this information deluge are worthy of ultimate power!		4				
1502111322	3	1	Vonnegut		Warm-up's over. Go, defeat that false ruler... claim your rightful reward.		9				
1502111323	3	1	Lilith		Yes, that's the feeling... a deadly trick needs to be watered with blood!		9				
1502111324	3	1	Lilith		I am the beginning, I am the end! (Wild laughter) Everyone gets cheese, everyone gets poison wine! In the Ascension-Network, everyone's dreams come true! Hahahaha!		20				
1502111325	3	1	Lilith		My dear Aunt, as a thank you... I'll show you the true meaning of selection!		11				
130202051	3	1	Eleanor		Oh? You're awake already, you're a fast healer.		4				
130202052	3	1	Eleanor		Look, it's hanging over there. Don't worry, it's in better shape than you are; I put a few stitches in it.		4				
130202053	3	1	Eleanor		Interesting expression... just a little something I whipped up, I happen to know someone who's handy with a needle.		4				
130202054	3	1	Eleanor		Ah... I'm stuffed, what a shame. Could you help me finish this?		4				
130202055	3	1	Eleanor		Or maybe not, it might be rude... to give someone something you've already tasted, right?		4				
130202056	3	1	Eleanor		Alright, I'll stop teasing you now.		4				
130202057	3	1	Eleanor		Looks like they set up quite the stage here, and left this machine behind.		4				
130202058	3	1	Eleanor		Hmm? There's a coin here. Want to give it a try?		4				
130202059	3	1	Eleanor		At least... the bad luck wasn't used on something else.		4				
1302020510	3	1	Eleanor		Not bad, they must have forgotten to grab the grand prize.		4				
1302020511	3	1	Eleanor		This trophy... is it the reward after the machine clears everything out?		4				
1302020512	3	1	Eleanor		Since you helped it see the light of day, why not take it as a souvenir?		4				
1302020513	3	1	Eleanor		There might be quite a few of those coins left around here. Want to hunt for them together?		4				
1302020514	3	1	Eleanor		I heard some people toss coins above the ceiling lights, they believe it brings good luck... Need a hand?		4				
1302020515	3	1	Eleanor		You're welcome, just a little trick I picked up a long time ago.		4				
1302020516	3	1	Eleanor		There's an unfinished game here... Want to try to finish it?		4				
1302020517	3	1	Eleanor		Though, a game without punishments or rewards tends to kill the competitive spirit... How about the loser tries this? Relax, it probably just looks weird.		4				
1302020518	3	1	Eleanor		Take it easy. Maybe it just looks a little strange?		4				
1302020519	3	1	Eleanor		Not quite getting the rules? It's pretty straightforward...		4				
1302020520	3	1	Eleanor		Punishment time? That's a cute face...		4				
1302020521	3	1	Eleanor		I'm starting to wonder if you actually enjoy the taste of that stuff.		4				
1302020522	3	1	Eleanor		Then I'll take a taste. Are you curious about the flavor? Why not try it yourself next time?		4				
1302020523	3	1	Eleanor		Loser pays up, looks like you're letting me have all the tasting opportunities?		4				
1302020524	3	1	Eleanor		"My choice will be ""rock""."		4				
1302020525	3	1	Eleanor		"Here, I'll go with ""scissors""."		4				
1302020526	3	1	Eleanor		Choosing trust in a loop of suspicion and doubt... you're getting more and more interesting to me.		4				
1302020527	3	1	Eleanor		Doubt and trust both hold the same power... but in a game, they can easily lead people down a dark path, don't you think?		4				
1302020528	3	1	Eleanor		"The card to be played face down is ""paper""."		4				
1302020529	3	1	Commandant		A brief sleep... if we can call it that. My body feels somewhat relieved.		4				
1302020530	3	1	Commandant		The stitching marks are very subtle. Did she search my body while mending my clothes? Has she discovered my identity?		4				
1302020531	3	1	Commandant		...No, there's no point. Even if I discover something, she won't be honest about it.		4				
1302020532	3	1	Commandant		The rich aroma of brewing coffee wafts through the air. Looking over, you see Eleanor delicately sipping a cup of coffee.		4				
1302020533	3	1	Commandant		After a brief rest, the tantalizing aroma awakens a sudden pang of hunger within you.		4				
1302020534	3	1	Commandant		Take the token from Lilith		4				
1302020535	3	1	Commandant		The gaming machine is completely empty. Nothing of importance remains inside.		4				
1302020536	3	1	Commandant		You gently shake the gaming machine, but nothing happens.		4				
1302020537	3	1	Commandant		A metallic glint catches your eye from the darkness of the prize dispenser. A token drops out.		4				
1302020538	3	1	Commandant		This oldest machine appears to have broken down earlier than the others. There's nothing inside it.		4				
1302020539	3	1	Commandant		Found a dust-covered token on the display screen		4				
1302020540	3	1	Commandant		In the corner of the flowerbed, a token sits quietly, half-embedded at an angle in the soil. Someone must have dropped it here.		4				
1302020541	3	1	Commandant		A playing card flies from Eleanor's hand, precisely striking the coin placed on the ceiling light and knocking it down		4				
1302020542	3	1	Commandant		Catch the tokens in your hand before they hit the ground		4

150213085	4	1	Alpha		Want me to keep an eye on the surroundings...? Fine, I'll help, but just this once.		0				
150213090	4	1	Alpha		You... are strong.		0				
300630331	1	1	Tatyana	501015	This strange machine... what exactly is it?!		0				
300630332	1	1	Schulz	700021	...		0				{1: '1', 2: '1'}
300630333	1	1	Tatyana	501015	Tch, another crazy Corrupted machine!		0				
300630334	1	1	Tatyana	501015	Something feels strange... Why do I have a feeling that this isn't my first time encountering this crazy Corrupted machine?!		0				
300630335	1	1	Schulz	700021	...		0				{1: '1', 2: '1'}
300630336	1	1	Tatyana	501015	And it seems even stronger than last time. How annoying!!		0				
969924991	3	1	Bianca		Commandant, please follow me.		3				
969924992	3	1	Bianca		This is where the Sacred Prayer Ritual is held.		3				
969924993	3	1	Bianca		Is that so? Though... it's not something I often see...		6				
969924994	3	1	Bianca		It's much the same as always, though I seldom have the chance to see it myself...		6				
969924995	3	1	Bianca		How about we slow time down a little?		3				
969924996	3	1	Bianca		Just a little privilege of being the Holy Maiden. There's still much to prepare, so...		7				
969924997	3	1	Bianca		...My apologies, Commandant. I let my haste get the better of me.		4				
969924998	3	1	Bianca		Yeah, let's take it slowly.		2				
969924999	3	1	Bianca		While I prepare for the ritual, feel free to speak with the others. I'll be waiting here for you.		5				
969924910	1	1	Bonnie	500055	Oh, you're finally here. Listen, I told her it's fine to show a little affection when she's with someone she cares about.		0				{1: '1'}
969924911	1	1	Bonnie	500055	"She always brushes me off—""duty this, mission that!"" But the second I bring you up? She just gets quiet."		0				{1: '1'}
969924912	1	1	Bonnie	500055	I could tell she wants to let loose, but her position makes it hard.		0				{1: '1'}
969924913	1	1	Bonnie	500055	Sooo... I may have fibbed a little and said your injury isn't fully healed yet, you know, so she has to take care of you.		0				{1: '1'}
969924914	1	1	Bonnie	500055	Play along later, okay? Don't make it awkward for her!		0				{1: '1'}
969924915	1	1	Father Snow	500022	...It seems she has found what she wants to protect.		0				{1: '1'}
969924916	1	1	Father Snow	500022	...Heh, it's nothing. I put the lily seeds over there. You might need them during the ritual.		0				{1: '1'}
969924917	1	1	Venice	500259	Look, the Holy Maiden and that commandant are holding hands! They're kind of like...		0				{1: '1'}
969924918	1	1	Venice's Sister	500260	Like Mom and Dad?		0				{2: '1'}
969924919	1	1	Venice	500259	Right, right... Wait, no no no!		0				{1: '1'}
969924920	1	1	Rosie	500726	You mean like... lovers, right?		0				{1: '1'}
969924921	1	1	Venice	500259	Yeah, lovers!		0				{1: '1'}
969924922	1	1	Rosie	500726	But... Holy Maiden has to hold up the Sacred Sword someday. What if the curse...		0				{1: '1'}
969924923	1	1	Venice	500259	Don't worry! The commandant will protect her, right?		0				{1: '1'}
969924924	1	1	Davis	500131	Commandant, you're finally here!		0				{1: '1'}
969924925	1	1	Davis	500131	I've been... blacking out more and more these days. Feels like my body's not even mine anymore. At this rate, I don't think I've got much time left...		0				{1: '1'}
969924926	1	1	Davis	500131	My mom's still waiting back home... If you ever swing by, say hi for me, will ya?		0				{1: '1'}
969924927	1	1	Davis	500131	Hahaha, just kidding. The Holy Maiden's blessings have given us all some peace of mind. I'm feeling better now.		0				{1: '1'}
969924928	1	1	Davis	500131	Though... I hear her blessing for you is special. Don't go wasting it, alright?		0				{1: '1'}
969924929	3	1	Bianca		Lily seeds? I was just about to fetch them... It seems the heavens have aligned our thoughts.		7				
969924930	3	1	Bianca		Father Snow has brought back some lily seeds. While I prepare, might I ask you to fetch them for me?		7				
969924931	3	1	Bianca		Let us begin, then.		3				
969924932	3	1	Bianca		It's a bit early in the year, but it's already warm enough for the flowers to bloom.		5				
969924933	3	1	Bianca		Bonnie told me your injuries haven't fully healed.		3				
969924934	3	1	Bianca		Here, give me your hands and close your eyes.		5				
969924935	3	1	Bianca		O Heavenly Father, may You send gentle winds to smooth the folds of suffering and soft snow to fill the trenches of our scars...		10				
969924945	3	1	Bianca		Even if Your gaze can only watch over living souls, may the threads bind their pain to my palms...		10				
969924949	3	1	Bianca		Let 【kuroname】's blood share warmth with mine, and let 【kuroname】's heart beat with the same warmth as mine.		7				
969924936	3	1	Bianca		...I've already checked. You seem perfectly healthy now. Is there really anything wrong?		6				
969924937	3	1	Bianca		You aren't actually ill, are you?		3				
969924938	3	1	Bianca		You... and Bonnie...		4				
969924939	3	1	Bianca		...You know that the Snowfields haven't been peaceful this year, right?		6				
969924940	3	1	Bianca		"Monsters crawled out from the ""Abyss"" and attacked the towns. Then the plague broke out... and blizzards raged for over a month."		3				
969924941	3	1	Bianca		Only at the summit of the mountain can my prayers reach the divine most clearly.		3				
969924942	3	1	Bianca		I'd stay with you if I could... but my prayers at the summit are for the sake of all, including you.		3				
969924943	3	1	Bianca		I'm touched that you worry for me... but this is my sacred duty.		3				
969924944	3	1	Bianca		Well... how about this?		3				
969924950	3	1	Bianca		No matter where you are, I will always protect you. Even when I'm not by your side, my prayers will bless you, Commandant.		11				
969924946	1	1	【kuroname】		I see.		0				
969924947	1	1	【kuroname】		What did you say?		0				
969924948	1	1	【kuroname】		How are you feeling?		0

103601231	3	1	Liv		You shouldn't have left that child to her own devices...		3				
103601232	3	1	Meli		But what else... could I have done?		3				
103601233	3	1	Meli		I couldn't give her love like a human could. So I gave her everything else she asked for... including you, and that human.		10				
103601234	3	1	Liv		She's drawing energy from the minerals... We have to stop her!		4				
103601235	3	1	Meli		It's useless...		3				
103601236	3	1	Liv		I can see your love for her. But I... I have someone I must protect too.		5				
103601237	3	1	Liv		Wake up, Melinoe...		3				
103601211	3	1	Liv		Let's move out, Commandant.		3				
103601212	3	1	Liv		Huff... Feeling rested? Then let's go.		4				
103601213	3	1	Liv		Hmm? A recording device... looks like the Rodent Squad left it behind.		6				
103601214	3	1	Flayo		This is Flayo of the Rodent Squad. We're clearing the mine when we stumbled on a hidden lab inside...		6				
103601215	3	1	Liv		That noise drew too many monsters. If we rush in now, the mine could collapse...		6				
103601216	3	1	Liv		Are those the crane controls on that platform?		3				
103601217	3	1	Liv		Down below... is that a new tunnel entrance?		3				
103601218	3	1	Liv		Let's go check it out, Commandant.		3				
103601219	3	1	Liv		Commandant, there's another crane and some rocks here...		3				
1036012110	3	1	Liv		...There's a hollow space beneath us. We might be able to clear a path with the crane, like before.		7				
1036012111	3	1	Liv		This crane isn't fully powered. There must be more switches around here. Let's look for them, Commandant.		7.5				
1036012112	3	1	Liv		...Drones... Still following their original programs? Where are they headed?		3				
1036012113	3	1	Liv		These vehicles are still operational... We can use them to reach the lab ahead.		4				
1036012114	3	1	Liv		A new supply crate!		2				
1036012115	3	1	Liv		There's a camp up ahead, Commandant. Let's rest a bit.		3				
1036012116	3	1	Liv		Commandant... what kind of research do you think they did here?		6				
1036012117	3	1	Liv		The Rodent Squad... I've only ever heard the name. Never had the chance to work with them myself.		6				
1036012118	3	1	Liv		There are hover platforms over there... We can use them to reach the platform with the vehicles.		15				
1036012119	3	1	Liv		There's the entrance! With the hover platforms, we can get to the vehicle platform next.		6				
1036012120	3	1	Liv		This vehicle will take us to the next area.		3				
1036012121	3	1	Liv		Ugh... Who's there?! Commandant, watch out!		3				
1036012122	3	1	???		(Maniacal laughter)		3				
1036012123	3	1	Liv		Commandant! You're safe... thank goodness.		3				
1036012124	3	1	Flayo		This place... the magnetic field here forms a strange cycle...		6				
1036012125	3	1	Flayo		We've tested it many times and learned the pattern...		4				
1036012126	3	1	Flayo		If you spot an anomaly, turn back. If not, keep going. Do it right eight times, and you'll get through.		8				
1036012127	3	1	Liv		A strange cycle... Commandant, let's move ahead and test it.		4				
1036012128	3	1	Liv		"The magnetic field is distorted... we're back where we started. Did we miss an ""anomaly"" just now?"		6				
1036012129	3	1	Liv		What is this...! A mechanoid... child?!		4				
1036012130	3	1	Liv		We made it out... This should be the end of the mine.		5

1036012132	1	1			(It looks like a small mechanoid child, carefully maintained. The frame is clean and tidy but must have fallen, breaking its core beyond repair.)		0				{1: '1'}

1036012133	3	1	Meli		(Gasps in pain)		5				
1036012134	3	1	Meli		Still falling for it, Liv?		3				
1036012135	3	1	Meli		Took the bait again.		2				
1036012136	3	1	Meli		Still holding back? How kind of you...		6				
1036012137	3	1	Meli		I'm no fighter... She'll take you on.		6				
1036012138	3	1	Meli		Not enough power... but time is on our side.		7				
1036012139	3	1	Meli		No... not yet...		12				
1036012140	3	1	Meli		You'll hurt her only over my dead body!		7				
1036012141	3	1	Meli		...Hesitating, Liv?		3				
1036012142	3	1	Meli		I see your sorrow. I hear your pain.		5				
1036012143	3	1	Meli		Let it go. Stay here with me.		2				
1036012144	3	1	Meli		Geez...		2				
1036012145	3	1	Meli		Done hiding?		2				
1036012146	3	1	Meli		Hear their screams...		2				
1036012147	3	1	Meli		Very well.		2				
1036012148	3	1	Meli		Where can you run?		2				
1036012149	3	1	Meli		Watch yourself.		2				
1036012150	3	1	Meli		It's not over.		3				
1036012151	3	1	Meli		Bind, die.		3				
1036012152	3	1	Meli		Pain will consume all...		4				
1036012153	3	1	Meli		Need more... time...		6
