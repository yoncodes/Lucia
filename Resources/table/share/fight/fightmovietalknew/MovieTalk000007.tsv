902	3	1	Teddy		This is Teddy. I can hear you—Commandant?		5				
903	3	1	Teddy		Vital signs are stable... Slight dizziness is a normal side effect of immersion. There's no need to activate the medical insurance you got from Star of Life yet.		12				
904	3	1	Asimov		Begin monitoring Gestalt's internal defense system—		4				
905	3	1	Teddy		—Monitoring system loaded. Ready, Commandant?		5				
906	3	1	Teddy		Gestalt's security programs... Must be something wrong over there.		6				
907	3	1	Teddy		They might attack indiscriminately. Get ready, Commandant.		5				
908	3	1	Teddy		The remaining data fluctuation is weird... Let's check it out.		6				
909	3	1	Teddy		...Tsk, did we trigger Gestalt's internal security system...?		5

911	3	1	Asimov		"The data fragment you sent over has subtle but the same fluctuation as ""that message."""		5				
912	3	1	Asimov		We have to look deeper into this.		4				
913	3	1	Teddy		There's... something in this message.		4				
914	3	1	Teddy		The key for disabling Gestalt's internal security programs...? Why is it here?		7				
915	3	1	Asimov		—Okay. Just be careful.		4				
916	3	1	[Security System]		—Clearance confirmed. Access granted—		5				
917	3	1	Teddy		Who hid it here...? Let's head up, Commandant.		8				
918	3	1	Teddy		Who hid it here...?		5				
919	3	1	Teddy		Let's head up, Commandant.		4				
920	3	1	Teddy		New security programs... Something's off. Is the password working, Commandant?		8				
921	3	1	[Security System]		—System e-error. Unauthorized a-access—		6				
922	3	1	Teddy		Wait... These are not Gestalt's security programs!		5				
923	3	1	Teddy		Let's look at other data first, Commandant. We'll put the abnormal data aside for now.		8				
924	3	1	Teddy		...Environment not match. We can't read the data fragment right now. Let's send it back and let Asimov handle it.		7				
925	3	1	Teddy		...Are you sure about the coordinates, Asimov? We're at the border of Gestalt's safe area already.		10				
926	3	1	Asimov		I've analyzed the second data segment you sent. The closer you get to the abnormal data, the more its fluctuation matches the target. I've traced the data and sent you the coordinates.		10				
927	3	1	Teddy		Hm... With the coordinates, we can jump to the location of the abnormal data directly, but that's outside Gestalt's safe area. I'm not sure about what lies beyond the abnormal data.		16				
928	3	1	Teddy		If anything happens, Asimov, terminate the immersion program immediately.		5				
929	3	1	Asimov		Those are the security programs with unknown data—watch out for them—		8				
930	3	1	Teddy		—Data read successfully. Like I thought.		5				
931	3	1	Teddy		So... this is where the abnormal data came from? Weird... Asimov, can you observe the data stream of this place out there?		12				
932	3	1	Asimov		I can't. The place you're in is beyond the range I can observe. Judging from the location, it might be—		12				
933	3	1	Teddy		—The call is cut. Should we go in and check it out, Commandant?		6				
934	3	1	Teddy		The unknown security programs... Looks like they're in hibernation. Let's check out the data over there before they wake up.		10				
935	3	1	Teddy		...Hm? What's wrong, Commandant?		0				
936	3	1	Teddy		Hm.		0

1724	1	1	Lucia	700019	Any idea why Lithos was trying to help this Professor Trout?		0				
1725	1	1	Rose	700019	Professor Trout was going to adopt us, and Lithos said he wanted to repay him for that. Professor Trout is gone, though, and Lithos has to take care of the things Professor Trout didn't finish.		0				
1726	1	1	Lucia	700019	Did Professor Trout tell you what it is that he needed you guys to do for him?		0				
1727	1	1	Rose	700019	Uhm... I think... it's got to do with memory data.		0				
1728	1	1	Rose	700019	Lithos told me that memory data is this thing that turns everything in the human brain into data and stores it somewhere else. Some people change their bodies using it.		0				
1729	1	1	Rose	700019	I hope it's something that allows people to change their bodies, though. I really want to see Professor Trout alive again...		0				
1730	1	1	Rose	700019	Yup. Lithos told me that mom and dad were researchers when they were still around. A lot of our family members are gifted when it comes to science.		0				
1731	1	1	Rose	700019	"Lithos knows more than I do, though. Our Fathers said Lithos would have been adopted a long time ago had his mother been a ""good"" mother and that he hadn't been born disabled."		0				
1732	1	1	Lucia	700019	This talent... Is it what this Professor Trout is after?		0				
1733	1	1	Rose	700019	Uhm? Professor Trout was just trying to get us out of the orphanage so we could go to school properly...		0				
1734	1	1	Lucia	700019	Trout... memory data... and Lithos... All of this reminds me of someone in particular.		0				
1735	1	1	Rose	700019	How do you guys know this name? I thought he only told me and Lithos this name?		0				
1736	1	1	Rose	700019	We're all Professor Trout's friends, then, since he told you guys this name.		0				
1737	1	1	Lucia	700019	Another question for you, Rose. Why did Lithos bring Trout's memory data all the way to Constellia?		0				
1738	1	1	Rose	700019	I don't know, but I think he said... it's because there's a secret base here?		0				
1739	1	1	Lucia	500994	Have you found it?		0				
1740	1	1	Rose	700019	...No... And Lithos isn't here, either... And I can't get out of here.		0				
1741	1	1	Rose	500994	Yes, most of the people are at the art gallery. There are also mercenaries who would come and take our things every now and then.		0				
1742	1	1	Lucia	500994	Let's head over to the art gallery, Commandant. That's where Chaos went missing, too.		0				
1743	1	1	Lucia	500994	Those red butterflies...! Cradle is likely to be around here.We might be putting ourselves at risk if we try to force our way through now, given how little we know about this place. Should we try to see if there is a way around?		0				
1744	3	1	Lucia		Corrupted! Watch out, Commandant!		5				
1745	3	1	Lucia		These butterflies... Cradle must be nearby.		5				
1746	1	1	Lucia	500994	Let's watch out for her. She's not gonna leave us alone. Let's get Rose back to the art gallery to meet up with the people there.		0				
1747	3	1	Lucia		Chaos?!		3				
1748	3	1	Lucia		She's gone...		3				
1749	3	1	Lucia		Watch out for the Red Tide! Take Rose to higher ground!		5				
1750	3	1	Lucia		There is no end to dealing with these things! Cradle did this all the time in Hetero Tower.		5				
1751	3	1	Lucia		Let's get out of here before they wear us out!		5				
1752	3	1	Lucia		"The facilities here have nothing to do with combat. There isn't even a whole lot of life-related equipment here. It's like an artist transcending the mundane—both their body and soul exist solely for this ""Golden Time Court""."		15				
1753	3	1	Lucia		...I've only ever seen a commercial for this place when I was a kid in commercials for business tenants. This is my first time coming here.		8				
1754	3	1	【kuroname】		And you still remember the commercial?		3

2008	1	1	Rose	501005	Yes... Lithos told me that Professor Trout had gone poof and his house had been sealed off when our adoption process was almost finalized. Lithos went to look for him and came back telling me that he'd passed...		0

2061	1	1	Mercenary A	500123	If you ask me, though, I'd say they deserved what came their way. If they all had worked as hard as you guys did, ain't no way they'd have been fired, right?		0

2065	1	1	Lucia	500994	A floating cruiser... Should we take this and check out the city from up there? I mean we could try going up with you clinging to me, but a floating cruiser seems to be the safer choice here with Rose around, in case we run into anything going up.		0				
2066	1	1	Lucia	500994	We need an access card. Lee probably could deactivate this thing for us were he here.		0				
2067	1	1	Lucia	500994	Chaos?!		0				
2068	1	1	Rose	501005	That man... I've seen him before. The butterflies killed him earlier.		0

2078	3	1	Lucia		No, I'm fine. Just thought I'd check on you.		6
