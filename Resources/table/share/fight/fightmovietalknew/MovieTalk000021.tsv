301304624	3	1	Rain		Of all people, I didn't think you would be the one asking this...		3.25				
301304625	3	1	Yun Ye		Rain, if you truly seek enlightenment, I shall rightfully pass my divine station to you when the time comes. But for now, please... stop this.		7.25

969926084	3	1	Lilith		Oh? Raising your scissors against me?		4.25

3072299	2	1	???		Discord obtained information about the truth through some means (needs narrative packaging) - Keep brief		5				
3072111	1	1	Gossipy Resident		They say when the big man at the workshop's daughter got sick, he ran all over town buying her medicine and spent every moment he could at her bedside.		0				
3072112	1	1	Gossipy Resident		Most of the time he looked like a fool, but whenever he spoke of his daughter he became serious. He always said he promised to give her the very best.		0				
3072113	1	1	Gossipy Resident		Wait, did he even have a daughter?		0				
3072121	1	1	Needle		I don't know anything. After the gathering ended, I just went back to sewing the orders for my clients.		0				
3072122	1	1	Scissors		Yes, I can vouch for that.		0				
3072123	1	1	Discord	501191	(Lying.)		0				
3072124	1	1	Scissors		Thread went to pick up the top-up for both of us. There are witnesses who can prove it. Fabric was on the phone with clients the entire time. The workshop's surveillance footage stayed <color=#FF0000>intact</color> right up until the fire broke out.		0				
3072125	1	1	Needle		Yes. After the master went back to his room, he <color=#FF0000>locked</color> the door. He must have been drunk and didn't notice the fire. We couldn't save him. It was... an unfortunate accident.		0				
3072126	1	1	Discord	501191	(The door was locked... Doesn't make sense.)		0				
3072131	1	1	Needle		What do we do... they're going to find out... they're going to find out!		0				
3072132	1	1	Scissors		You don't have to worry, alright? I'll protect you. You haven't done anything wrong. And besides, the police have no evidence.		0				
3072141	1	1	Sleepless Resident		The night after the tailor workshop burned down, I saw a dark figure rushing out in a hurry...		0				
3072146	1	1	Sleepless Resident		The way he moved... it looked like he was burying something.		0				
3072161	1	1	Frightened Resident		It's terrifying. They say the fire was caused by old wiring.		0				
3072162	1	1	Frightened Resident		If you ask me, he just didn't want to give up the workshop, so he set the fire himself!		0				
3072163	1	1	Frightened Resident		It's all retribution...		0				
3072171	1	1	Gossipy Resident		At first, it was that thin girl apprentice who bought supplies for the workshop. Later it became those two apprentices, a man and a woman, doing it together.		0

30721121	1	1	Discord	501191	All of this... just for a false hope!		0				
30721131	1	1	Discord	501191	Was I blinded all this time, misled by Needle?		0				
30721141	1	1	Discord	501191	Someone moved these fabrics ahead of time.		0				
30721151	1	1	Discord	501191	These are the scissors the old tailor loved most. But why is there no trace of blood? Could this not be the real murder weapon?		0				
30721152	1	1	Discord	501191	If so, then why would Fabric hide the scissors?		0				
30721153	1	1	Discord	501191	That notch in the blades... it doesn't sit right with me.		0				
30721161	1	1	Discord	501191	It's all tangled, just like this mess of threads... what am I still missing?		0				
30721171	1	1	Discord	501191	Damn it. Why did I ignore all this back then?		0				
30721181	1	1	Discord	501191	The old tailor would never have placed electrical machines in the living quarters...		0				
30721182	1	1	Discord	501191	This... this is the real murder weapon. And the real killer.		0
