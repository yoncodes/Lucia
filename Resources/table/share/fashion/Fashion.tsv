When spring arrives, she wanders along the melting river; when autumn comes, she touches the fallen petals. On rainy days, the girl plays her music alone in the secluded temple, waiting for the sun to rise again. Accompanied by the sky and four seasons, she grasps the remaining fragments. No matter how far they are apart from each other and if the world responds to her invocation, she will keep praying for the one she misses. The rain gradually eases off in the sound of her flute. When dawn comes, the bell rings too. When the sky clears, flowers will bloom again.

With warm words and a benevolent heart, the scent of medicine spreads with the warm breeze, transforming the cold night into a melody of spring.

As the world-drowning dust storm swallows the last sliver of twilight, she emerges from the depths of this abyss where the dead gather. The divinities of ruin bow their heads, bestowing upon the newcomer the honor known as eternal silence. She is the shepherd who comforts all lost souls, and the general who commands death itself. She walks the fractured boundaries between existence and oblivion, gazing over the hunting grounds where eternity has fallen mute. In her realm, there is nothing—only the void's quietude, soundlessly proclaiming: death is the most ancient mercy life can receive.
