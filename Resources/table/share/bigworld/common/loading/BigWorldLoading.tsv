Babylonia became the shelter for many survivors who had escaped to space.\nNow, Babylonia is anchored in the arc orbital dock and, as the starting point for taking back Earth, it maintains close ties with ground forces.

12	Babylonia District Overview	"""Architecture begins with a question and ends in the search for an answer. Babylonia, this immense man-made structure flying in Earth's orbit, stands as an ever-evolving response from architects to the challenge of survival in the wake of the Punishing crisis.\nThe distinct sectors we see today—divided by function yet diverse in form—transcend both time and culture. Their overlapping styles faithfully mirror the circumstances our predecessors faced, and the solutions they dared to attempt.\nThis book is written to guide those who come after us, so they may walk this long path and discover their own answers. And above all, let us remember this: it is humanity's love and hope for its home that architecture was always meant to carry.""\n— Preface to Introduction to Architecture in the Post-Pandemic Age"	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BigWorld/Common/UiBigWorldLoading/UiBigWorldLoading14.png	1
