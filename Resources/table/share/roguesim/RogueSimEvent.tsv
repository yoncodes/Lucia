10101					3		New Branch	New Branch	"""Your decision was a success. After the online promotion, the store is packed with travelers both inside and outside. However, these travelers value online reviews. To keep the ""best store"" verification, Changyu has to spend extra time preparing Kowloong snacks as gifts for them.

10102					3		New Branch	New Branch	You went for a low-margin, high-volume strategy to maintain the store's reputation among locals, and it turned out to be a success. The Akdilek branch quickly became a nice store among local people. Many old customers come back every day. However, these customers are quite sensitive to prices. Sophia racks her brains every day to keep the costs under control and make sure there's no inventory backlog. Both of you are exhausted after the hustle.	[1010201]	
10201					3	10201	New Branch Management	New Branch Management	A while later, Sophia and Changyu come to you again.

10304					3		Getting On Track	Getting On Track	You show the detailed operation data of the Akdilek branch to them to prove that it has not hindered the development of local business.

However, Karenina is not mad at all. She looks happy.	[1040201]	
10403					3		Boosting Reputation	Boosting Reputation	You and Karenina arrive at the mountain to collect some old wood to be used as the building material.

Besides, you know a place with breathtaking views that is suitable for outdoor interviews. The channel accepts your advice, and the result turns out to be amazing. The store has become a store with a human touch among netizens, which brings more visitors to the store.	[1070401]	
10801					3		Laying the Pipeline	Laying the Pipeline	The store has attracted many new customers after the expansion, and your supplies are not enough to meet the demand. To optimize the pipeline, you ask Ayla, who has rich experience in this, to be your consultant. After careful assessment, she suggests to build a logistics network to secure the following supplies. She also asks if you would like to bring in the local chamber of commerce, which would save you half the effort.	[1080101, 1080102]	
10802					3		Laying the Pipeline	Laying the Pipeline	Considering the previous gangster behavior of the local chamber of commerce, you decide to build the logistics network yourselves.	[1080201]	
10803					3		Laying the Pipeline	Laying the Pipeline	You ask the chamber of commerce that threatened you if they want to share the logistics network with you regardless. The representatives didn't expect you to be this generous. Feeling ashamed, they tell you the truth—they only asked for the additional supporting fund to maintain the operation because the island is far away from the continent and the transportation is poor. If there can be a logistics network, they swear they will never do it again and will return the money to the business owners.	[1080301]	
10901					3	10901	Independent Construction	Independent Construction	Under Ayla's leadership, the construction of the logistics network has soon passed the halfway mark. One day, the representatives of the local chamber of commerce visit you with some gifts. They would like to apologize and hope you can allow them to join the network. Feeling ashamed, they tell you the truth—they only asked for the additional supporting fund to maintain the operation because the island is far away from the continent and the transportation is poor. If there can be a logistics network, they swear they will never do it again and will return the money to the business owners.	[1090101, 1090102]	
10902					3		Independent Construction	Independent Construction	You politely tell them that you have no intention to bring in partners at the moment. They look embarrassed but soon realize that they're paying for what they did and leave. After hearing everything from you, Ayla also agrees that it's not the right time to have more people onboard and you should focus on the construction.	[1090201]	
10903					3		Independent Construction	Independent Construction	You generously accept their request and introduce them to Ayla the same day. Seeing the new partners, Ayla looks happy and is glad to have more assistance when she's buried in work and wishes the cats could help her if possible.	[1090301]	
11001					3	11001	Joint Construction	Joint Construction	Having heard that you're building a logistics network with the local chamber of commerce, business owners in the area all come to you and Ayla, asking you to allow them use it after it's completed. It turns out that the economic development of the island has been hindered by the poor transportation. They hope they can take this opportunity to break the limits and escape the rat race here on the island.	[1100101, 1100102]

It's one of the representatives who blackmailed you. He thought he's not qualified to attend the party, so he planned to return the money to everybody's store secretly while they're celebrating. He thanks you for the changes you brought to the island and leaves.	[1110501]	
11201					3		Here Comes a New Helper!	Here Comes a New Helper!	"""How can you go on an adventure without me, Commandant? I'm here to help you!"" Nanami suddenly appears with her machine friends in front of everyone, swearing to show her capabilities in the island branch. Nanami and her machine friends are all capable and strong. Think carefully about what tasks to assign them."	[1120101, 1120102]	
11202					3		Here Comes a New Helper!	Here Comes a New Helper!	"You think you can have several mechanoids bringing in customers from the streets, and it would definitely be perfect propaganda, so you ask Nanami to advertise your store on the streets. ""Bring everyone together, right? Got it!"" Nanami makes a V sign and skates away."	[1120201]	
11203					3		Here Comes a New Helper!	Here Comes a New Helper!	"Considering mechanoids are more efficient in transporting things than humans, you ask Nanami to collect some materials that the branch could use.

11301					3	11301	Super Promoter	Super Promoter	"Nanami's promotion strategy worked. The customers in the island branch have multiplied in just a few days. However, to your surprise, most of them are mechanoids who were always refused by other stores with the excuse of ""not capable of hosting mechanoids."" Nanami told them they're welcomed here, and it gives them a sense of belonging here."	[1130101, 1130102]	
11302					3		Super Promoter	Super Promoter	You ask Nanami if it is necessary to open a new branch for mechanoid customers, but she thinks there's no need to do this. She understands that your intention is good, but it would make them feel distant. Just keep it as it is and treat them as normal customers.	[1130201]	
11303					3		Super Promoter	Super Promoter	More and more mechanoid customers are coming to the store, but the human staff are not able to understand their needs very well. You find Nanami and ask her for suggestions. She tells you right away that you need to hire some mechanoid staff. You give it some thought and think it's a plausible solution.	[1130301]	
11401					3	11401	Super Collector	Super Collector	A while later, several stranger mechanoids come at your door. They saw Nanami and some mechanoids working on the island and want to see if you can take them in as well. According to them, they've been wandering around the coastal area for years since they were abandoned by humans. All they want now is a shelter, so they are willing to work for free.	[1140101, 1140102]	
11402					3		Super Collector	Super Collector	It's not bad to help more mechanoids, and the store needs more staff anyway. You accept it, and the mechanoids become staff of your branch.	[1140201]	
11403					3		Super Collector	Super Collector	You refuse and tell them they should have their own salaries. You will pay them according to their performance. The mechanoids are moved by your words with clear condensation liquid coming down from their broken camera eyes.	[1140301]	
11501					3	11501	Super Friendship Store	Super Friendship Store	"""There is a store where humans and mechanoids can be together on friendly terms."" This is a widespread rumor on the island. Your store has become not only the favorite gathering spot for residents, but also the home for many homeless mechanoids. Nanami is happy with the outcome, because she has finally realized the dream she had for a long time and that is having mechanoids and humans live together in harmony. ""So, what next?"" She asks, looking at you."	[1150101, 1150102]	
11502					3		Super Friendship Store	Super Friendship Store	"""Yeah, the store is now the home of many friends. We must keep it safe and sound."" Nanami makes a pinky swear with you, meaning she will never forget her promise."	[1150201]	
11503					3		Super Friendship Store	Super Friendship Store	"""More?"" Nanami looks at you in surprise and expectation. You then describe a wonderful picture of the future. There are still quite a few vacant lots on the island. You can turn them into stores and provide stable jobs to more mechanoids... ""Yes. I believe we can do this!"" Nanami gives you a smile of appreciation after you finish explaining the grand conception."	[1150301]

Dressed like a tourist and wearing a sun hat, she looks like someone on vacation. Still, she is offering to help. Her usual calm smile is putting you under pressure. No doubt she is here to test you!

11702					3		Final Test	Final Test	You tell Ishmael honestly that there's no job vacancies at the moment and you don't need help. However, she doesn't seem to care and stays anyway, saying that she will find things to do here.	[1170201]

11802					3		Final Test II	Final Test II	"Sophia and Changyu took Ishmael to the beach. They created a huge but delicate super sand castle and took a group photo with Ishmael before the castle got pushed over by the waves.

11803					3		Final Test II	Final Test II	"Ayla and Karenina take Ishmael to dive around the coral reef... They come across a great white shark on the way. However, it flees just when Ayla and Karenina are ready to fight. ""Did we just get lucky... or the sharks here are nicer?""

11901					3	11901	Final Test III	Final Test III	A few days later, Ishmael invites you to spend a day out with her. Together, you explore all the famous attractions and amusement rides on the island, dive into the sea to admire the coral reefs, and collect seashells on the beach. As the sunset paints the sky and ocean into the same crimson color, she finally confesses that, at first, her visit was meant to be an assessment of the shop's business, but it somehow turned into a leisurely vacation. She is grateful for everything you have done to let her enjoy this journey. However, this brief escape must come to an end, and it is time for her to say goodbye. What do you want to say to her at this moment...?	[1190101, 1190102]	
11902					3		Final Test III	Final Test III	"""Yeah. It's great that you also had fun."" She slightly presses her straw hat and gazes into the distance beyond the sea. ""I will never forget this summer."""	[1190201]	
11903					3		Final Test III	Final Test III	"You remember there's a beautiful spot on the island that you forgot to add to the itinerary, so you decide to take her to that mountain before sunset. Watching the sun set slowly into the sea from the top of the mountain is amazing. ""Although I've seen many sceneries, this one is still the best sunset I've ever seen."" She looks back at you with her face in the shadow against the light behind her. ""Thank you for everything. I will never forget this summer."""	[1190301]

30300					3		Bliss	Bliss	You come across a strange old man who sits on the cold shore all day gazing at the horizon affectionately. You sit down beside him, listening to his story. He was a soldier who fell in love with a Construct comrade. For years, he had been expressing his love indirectly without any response from her. Now, he's already an old man, but he still believes that one day, the Construct will understand him and come to him as a response to his love.	[3030001, 3030002]	
30301					3		Bliss	Bliss	"The old man smiles and nods with his eyes still fixed to the sea under the sunset. He says, ""She said she needed some time to think about it.

[3030101]	
30302					3		Bliss	Bliss	The old man doesn't respond. He watches the sun setting into the sea and then leaves silently. No one has seen him ever since.	[3030201]
